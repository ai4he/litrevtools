  "introduction": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, from text generation to complex question answering \\cite{brown2020language}. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are increasingly being applied is mathematical reasoning. The ability to understand, process, and generate mathematical content is fundamental to scientific discovery, engineering, finance, and many aspects of daily life. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of robust mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing goal in the field of AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The systematic analysis of reasoning processes, whether in natural language \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, yu2022analysiscorrelation}, formal logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis, carette2022centralsubmonads}, or applied domains like clinical reasoning \\cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}, is crucial for advancing AI capabilities. The design of supplementary mathematics modules, for instance, aims to improve students' reasoning abilities \\cite{heru2022designsupplementary}.\n\nRecent advancements in LLMs, particularly those based on transformer architectures \\cite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened new avenues for tackling complex mathematical problems. These models, trained on massive datasets, possess an emergent ability to perform arithmetic operations, solve algebraic equations, and even engage with more abstract mathematical concepts \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, wei2022chainofthought}. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remain active areas of research. Issues such as susceptibility to superficial patterns in problem descriptions \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}, the need for explicit reasoning capabilities \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}, and challenges in out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} highlight the ongoing challenges. The development of AI-assisted programming further underscores the integration of AI with structured problem-solving \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}. Furthermore, understanding the information-theoretic aspects of neural scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}, developing frameworks for formal methods \\cite{khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations}, and autoformalizing mathematical problems \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural} are critical for advancing rigorous reasoning systems. The generation of synthetic data for training models \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain, shridhar2022automaticgeneration} and the exploration of multimodal reasoning \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense} also contribute to this evolving landscape. \\par\n\nResearch exploring counterfactual reasoning requires language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions, testing their understanding of causal relationships beyond real-world knowledge \\cite{li2022counterfactualreasoning}. Constructing datasets for specific linguistic phenomena, such as Arabic reading comprehension, is also an ongoing effort \\cite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria for impulse response functions highlights the application of mathematical reasoning in signal processing \\cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit}. Continual learning in 3D point clouds aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge without forgetting past information, a challenge relevant to robust AI development \\cite{zamorski2022continuallearning}. Contrastive language-image pre-training with knowledge graphs enhances multi-modal reasoning by injecting semantic information \\cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}. ConvFinQA focuses on numerical reasoning in conversational finance question answering, posing challenges for modeling long-range numerical reasoning paths \\cite{chen2022convfinqaexploring}. A correction to a paper on Dirac's theory of radiation discusses the inception and reception of tools for quantum field theorists, involving complex reasoning processes \\cite{ehberger2022correctionlanguage}. Counterfactual decoding is explored for anti-hallucination knowledge-grounded dialogue generation \\cite{chen2022counterfactualdecoding}. Creative mathematical reasoning and its relation to cognitive motivation are investigated \\cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical}. Critical analysis of big data applications using functional linguistics and diversified integration explores advancements in artificial reasoning \\cite{kumar2022criticalanalysis}. Cross-lingual speaker identification from weak local evidence is another area of AI application \\cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker}. CrunchQA is a dataset for question answering over a knowledge graph, highlighting challenges in multi-hop reasoning \\cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic}. Curriculum: A Broad-Coverage Benchmark for Linguistic Phenomena in Natural Language Understanding aims to diagnose models' linguistic skills \\cite{chen2022curriculumbroadcoverage}. DALL-Eval probes reasoning skills and social biases of text-to-image transformers \\cite{cho2022dallevalprobing}. \par\n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research at the intersection of large language models, mathematical reasoning, and related AI reasoning techniques.

These can be broadly categorized as follows:\n\n* \\textextbf{Arithmetic, Algebraic, and Mathematical Word Problems:} These tasks form the core of quantitative reasoning evaluations. Datasets like GSM8K and MATH \\cite{kobelski2022rethinking, hendrycks2021math} are frequently used to assess LLMs' ability to perform calculations, solve equations, and interpret natural language descriptions of mathematical scenarios. Surveys such as \\cite{lu2022surveydeep} provide a comprehensive overview of these tasks and associated datasets. Datasets like ArMATH are specifically designed for Arabic math word problems \\cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset}. The automatic generation of Socratic subquestions aims to aid in teaching math word problems \\cite{shridhar2022automaticgeneration}. The CLEVR-Math dataset targets compositional language, visual, and mathematical reasoning \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset}. Analysis of students' mathematical thinking and learning difficulties is also prevalent \\cite{shidqiya2022analysisstudents, amaliyah2022analisiskesulitan, hurst2022connectingsymbolic, jonsson2022creativemathematical, nuraina2022desainbahan}.

The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria for impulse response functions \\cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit} and the development of auxiliary teaching systems for higher mathematics \\cite{xiao2022auxiliaryteaching} are also relevant. The problem of understanding mathematical thinking abilities in relation to self-efficacy is examined \\cite{shidqiya2022analysisstudents}.\n\n* \\textextbf{Commonsense and Multimodal Reasoning:} Reasoning extends beyond pure mathematics to include everyday knowledge. Commonsense reasoning tasks are often evaluated using datasets that require understanding implicit information \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, wan2022bridgingbetween, kim2022cosimcommonsense, albalak2022commonsensereasoning}.

Computer-verified foundations of metaphysics and ontology are investigated \\cite{unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations}. Concurrent NetKAT models stateful, concurrent networks \\cite{wagemaker2022concurrentnetkat}. A methodology to characterize bias and harmful stereotypes in NLP leverages social scientists and machine learning experts \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize}. \par\n\n* \\textextbf{Causal Reasoning and Robustness:} Understanding the causal relationships within problem statements is crucial for robust reasoning. Frameworks for quantifying the robustness of mathematical reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} and achieving out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} are key areas of investigation.

Research on learning analytics considers expected usefulness and privacy concerns \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration}. The algorithm method is examined for teaching Russian \\cite{2022algorithmmethod}. Auxiliary teaching systems for higher mathematics are developed \\cite{xiao2022auxiliaryteaching}. Benchmarking student academic recovery is also a focus \\cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}. Classification of open-ended responses using NLP is explored in physics education research \\cite{wilson2022classificationopenended}.

CodeQueries is a dataset of semantic queries over code \\cite{sahu2022codequeriesdataset}.\n\n\\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}\n\nResearchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:\n\n\\subsubsection{Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning}\n\nTechniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \\cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \\cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \\cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \\cite{kar2022arggenprompting}. CAPE utilizes LLMs for corrective actions from precondition errors in planning \\cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Curriculum learning based prompt tuning (CUP) is applied for implicit event argument extraction \\cite{lin2022curriculumlearning}. The question of whether in-context learners can learn a reasoning concept from demonstrations is investigated \\cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations}. Auto-CoT is proposed for automatic chain of thought prompting \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. Complexity-based prompting is explored for multi-step reasoning \\cite{fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. Decomposed prompting offers a modular approach for complex tasks \\cite{khot2022decomposedprompting}. Counterfactual decoding is explored for anti-hallucination knowledge-grounded dialogue generation \\cite{chen2022counterfactualdecoding}. \n\n\\subsubsection{Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation}\n\nFine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalized Vision and Language (PerVL) models address user-specific concepts by extending input vocabulary \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}. Adaptive language models to reasoning tasks are explored \\cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Model transformation languages are compared \\cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}. Continual learning on 3D point clouds is explored with random compressed rehearsal \\cite{zamorski2022continuallearning}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Integration of External Tools and Knowledge}\n\nHybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \\cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Vadalog is a system designed for reasoning over large knowledge graphs \\cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. Retriever-augmented language models are studied for their reasoning capabilities \\cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Composing ensembles of pre-trained models via iterative consensus is proposed \\cite{li2022composingensembles}. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training with Knowledge Graphs is also a relevant study \\cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Formal Methods and Structured Reasoning}\n\nFormal methods are employed to ensure rigor and correctness. Petri nets enhance clinical reasoning \\cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}. Executable formal models, such as for VHDL \\cite{khan2022executableformal}, enable formal reasoning about designs. Experimentation frameworks for web service verification use declarative, mathematical formalisms \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework}. A semiotic analysis assesses the usefulness and limitations of multiple systems of logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis}.

  "discussion": "\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe collected 120 papers reveal a dynamic and rapidly evolving research landscape at the nexus of AI, particularly LLMs, and structured reasoning, including mathematical, logical, causal, multimodal, and educational domains. The findings underscore significant progress in AI's ability to perform quantitative tasks, ranging from basic arithmetic and algebraic problem-solving \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking, lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset} to sophisticated mathematical word problems \\cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset, shridhar2022automaticgeneration, wei2022chainofthought, chen2022convfinqaexploring}. Methodologies such as chain-of-thought prompting \\cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, fine-tuning on specialized datasets \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}, and the integration of external knowledge \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage} have been pivotal in achieving these advancements.\n\nA recurring theme is the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques like CoT for eliciting step-by-step reasoning \\cite{yu2022alertadapt, raman2022capecorrective}. This moves beyond mere pattern matching towards more transparent problem-solving processes. The combination of LLMs with formal methods, symbolic solvers, and knowledge graphs represents a powerful paradigm for leveraging the strengths of both neural and symbolic AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, wu2022autoformalizationwith, bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. The development of systems like Vadalog for knowledge graph reasoning \\cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog} further exemplifies this trend. The ability of transformers to reason in fragments of natural language \\cite{schlegel2022transformersreason} and the exploration of in-context learning \\cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations} contribute to understanding the fundamental reasoning capabilities of these models. Research on code as policies for embodied control \\cite{liang2022codepolicies} and semantic queries over code \\cite{sahu2022codequeriesdataset} demonstrates reasoning capabilities in programming contexts. Multimodal reasoning research, including \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense, smith2022constructvldatafree, liu2022deplotoneshot, cho2022dallevalprobing}, also highlights sophisticated reasoning over diverse data types. The design of circular air intakes for turbofans involves significant mathematical modeling \\cite{tsukanov2022designcircular}. \n\nDespite these successes, several challenges and research gaps remain prominent. \\textextbf{Robustness} is a critical concern, as highlighted by studies demonstrating that models can still rely on superficial cues rather than deep understanding \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Ensuring true mathematical reasoning, rather than mimicry, requires models that are resilient to variations in problem presentation and robust against adversarial manipulations \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Research on achieving out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} and understanding the causal underpinnings of reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, willig2022foundationmodels, li2022counterfactualreasoning, tian2022debiasingmodels} is essential to address this. The analysis of student self-assessment accuracy also points to robustness concerns in educational contexts \\cite{markta2022accuracypupils}.\n\n\\textextbf{Generalization to novel mathematical concepts and abstract reasoning} remains a significant hurdle \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. While current models excel in well-defined problem spaces, their ability to perform advanced theoretical reasoning, discover new mathematical principles, or adapt to entirely new domains is limited. Bridging this gap might involve deeper integration of structured knowledge \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge} and potentially new neuro-symbolic architectures \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}. The BIG-bench benchmark aims to quantify and extrapolate capabilities beyond imitation \\cite{srivastava2022beyondimitation}, highlighting areas where current models fall short. The limitations of retriever-augmented language models in reasoning are also noted \\cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Computer simulation of intelligent control systems \\cite{khuralay2022computersimulation} and the use of hybrid algorithms for complex problems \\cite{wang2022hybridgenetic, snchez2022clusteringapproach} also point to the challenges of generalization in applied domains. The performance of current models on Arabic reading comprehension datasets is also explored \\cite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. Differentiable reasoning over long stories assesses systematic generalization \\cite{li2022differentiablereasoning}. \n\n\\textextbf{Interpretability and explainability} of AI reasoning processes are also areas demanding further investigation. While methods like CoT offer some transparency \\cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, understanding the internal decision-making mechanisms of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks is still an open problem. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and debugging efforts, particularly in critical applications. Characterizing biases in NLP systems \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize} is intrinsically linked to interpretability, ensuring fairness and accountability. The use of NLP for classifying open-ended responses \\cite{wilson2022classificationopenended} and the development of interpretable methods for NER \\cite{chen2022btpkbasedlearning} are avenues towards better understanding model outputs. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria \\cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit} and the analysis of language change \\cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} also relate to understanding underlying processes. Despite \\\"super-human\\\" performance, current LLMs are unsuited for decisions about ethics and safety due to interpretability issues \\cite{albrecht2022despitesuperhuman}.\n\nThe potential for \\textextbf{personalization} in AI-driven reasoning tools, inspired by work in vision-language models \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn} and applied to areas like education \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration, markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics, xiao2022auxiliaryteaching, nuraina2022desainbahan}, offers exciting possibilities. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven assessments \\cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}, must be carefully addressed. The analysis of correlation between academic performance and learning motivation \\cite{yu2022analysiscorrelation} further contextualizes educational applications. Creative mathematical reasoning's relation to cognitive motivation \\cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical} and the critical analysis of big data applications \\cite{kumar2022criticalanalysis} also touch upon these areas.\n\nFurthermore, the study of \\textextbf{foundational aspects of logic and reasoning} continues to inform AI development. Semiotic analyses of logic systems \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis} and explorations of ontological commitment \\cite{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy} provide philosophical grounding. Research into information-theoretic scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} and comparisons of different algorithmic approaches \\cite{wankmller2022comparisonapproaches, wang2022comparisonthree, hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages} offer insights into optimizing AI systems. The benchmarking of various approaches, from spatial relationships in image generation \\cite{gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial} to ACOPF solutions \\cite{gopinath2022benchmarkinglargescale}, further contextualizes the performance and limitations of current AI systems. Computational stability and program testing are examined \\cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment}. Cross-lingual speaker identification \\cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker} and CrunchQA dataset for knowledge graph reasoning \\cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic} represent specific domains of investigation. \n\nFuture research should focus on developing AI systems that exhibit deeper understanding, greater robustness, and more profound generalization capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. This includes exploring novel neuro-symbolic architectures \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}, refining hybrid reasoning approaches \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture genuine reasoning skills rather than surface-level correlations \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial}. The development of executable formal models \\cite{khan2022executableformal} and experimentation frameworks \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework} will be crucial for verifying the correctness of AI-generated reasoning. The investigation into the interplay between retriever and language models for reasoning is also a promising direction \\cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Understanding the computational experiment process \\cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment} and leveraging data-free continual learning strategies \\cite{smith2022constructvldatafree} are also important future directions. Continual learning on 3D point clouds \\cite{zamorski2022continuallearning} and the analysis of language change \\cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} offer further avenues for advancement.\n\nIn summary, while AI, particularly LLMs, has made remarkable strides in quantitative and logical reasoning tasks, the quest for AI systems capable of truly independent and profound mathematical and logical reasoning continues. This review provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current landscape, highlighting both achievements and the critical avenues for future research, ultimately contributing to the development of more capable and trustworthy AI systems in quantitative and logical domains.

  "introduction": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, from text generation to complex question answering \\cite{brown2020language}. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are increasingly being applied is mathematical reasoning. The ability to understand, process, and generate mathematical content is fundamental to scientific discovery, engineering, finance, and many aspects of daily life. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of robust mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing goal in the field of AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The systematic analysis of reasoning processes, whether in natural language \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, yu2022analysiscorrelation}, formal logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis, carette2022centralsubmonads}, or applied domains like clinical reasoning \\cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}, is crucial for advancing AI capabilities. The design of supplementary mathematics modules, for instance, aims to improve students' reasoning abilities \\cite{heru2022designsupplementary}.\n\nRecent advancements in LLMs, particularly those based on transformer architectures \\cite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened new avenues for tackling complex mathematical problems. These models, trained on massive datasets, possess an emergent ability to perform arithmetic operations, solve algebraic equations, and even engage with more abstract mathematical concepts \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, wei2022chainofthought}. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remain active areas of research. Issues such as susceptibility to superficial patterns in problem descriptions \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}, the need for explicit reasoning capabilities \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}, and challenges in out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} highlight the ongoing challenges. The development of AI-assisted programming further underscores the integration of AI with structured problem-solving \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}. Furthermore, understanding the information-theoretic aspects of neural scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}, developing frameworks for formal methods \\cite{khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations}, and autoformalizing mathematical problems \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural} are critical for advancing rigorous reasoning systems. The generation of synthetic data for training models \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain, shridhar2022automaticgeneration} and the exploration of multimodal reasoning \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense, smith2022constructvldatafree, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage} also contribute to this evolving landscape. \\par\n\nResearch exploring counterfactual reasoning requires language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions, testing their understanding of causal relationships beyond real-world knowledge \\cite{li2022counterfactualreasoning}. Constructing datasets for specific linguistic phenomena, such as Arabic reading comprehension, is also an ongoing effort \\cite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria for impulse response functions highlights the application of mathematical reasoning in signal processing \\cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit}. Continual learning in 3D point clouds aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge without forgetting past information, a challenge relevant to robust AI development \\cite{zamorski2022continuallearning}. Contrastive language-image pre-training with knowledge graphs enhances multi-modal reasoning by injecting semantic information \\cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}. ConvFinQA focuses on numerical reasoning in conversational finance question answering, posing challenges for modeling long-range numerical reasoning paths \\cite{chen2022convfinqaexploring}. A correction to a paper on Dirac's theory of radiation discusses the inception and reception of tools for quantum field theorists, involving complex reasoning processes \\cite{ehberger2022correctionlanguage}. Counterfactual decoding is explored for anti-hallucination knowledge-grounded dialogue generation \\cite{chen2022counterfactualdecoding}. Creative mathematical reasoning and its relation to cognitive motivation are investigated \\cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical}.

Cross-lingual speaker identification from weak local evidence is another area of AI application \\cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker}. CrunchQA is a dataset for question answering over a knowledge graph, highlighting challenges in multi-hop reasoning \\cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic}.

DALL-Eval probes reasoning skills and social biases of text-to-image transformers \\cite{cho2022dallevalprobing}. \n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research at the intersection of large language models, mathematical reasoning, and related AI reasoning techniques. We address the following research questions:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \item What are the primary tasks and datasets used to evaluate AI models in mathematical and logical reasoning?\n    \item What are the dominant methodologies and architectures employed to enhance AI reasoning performance?\n    \item What are the key findings and limitations of current research in this area, including aspects of robustness, generalization, interpretability, and bias?\n    \item What are the promising future research directions for AI in mathematical and logical reasoning?\n\nTo address these questions, we conducted a systematic search of the literature.

  "discussion": "\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe collected 120 papers reveal a dynamic and rapidly evolving research landscape at the nexus of AI, particularly LLMs, and structured reasoning, including mathematical, logical, causal, multimodal, and educational domains. The findings underscore significant progress in AI's ability to perform quantitative tasks, ranging from basic arithmetic and algebraic problem-solving \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking, lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset} to sophisticated mathematical word problems \\cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset, shridhar2022automaticgeneration, wei2022chainofthought, chen2022convfinqaexploring}. Methodologies such as chain-of-thought prompting \\cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, fine-tuning on specialized datasets \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}, and the integration of external knowledge \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage} have been pivotal in achieving these advancements.\n\nA recurring theme is the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques like CoT for eliciting step-by-step reasoning \\cite{yu2022alertadapt, raman2022capecorrective}. This moves beyond mere pattern matching towards more transparent problem-solving processes. The combination of LLMs with formal methods, symbolic solvers, and knowledge graphs represents a powerful paradigm for leveraging the strengths of both neural and symbolic AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, wu2022autoformalizationwith, bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. The development of systems like Vadalog for knowledge graph reasoning \\cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog} further exemplifies this trend. The ability of transformers to reason in fragments of natural language \\cite{schlegel2022transformersreason} and the exploration of in-context learning \\cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations} contribute to understanding the fundamental reasoning capabilities of these models. Research on code as policies for embodied control \\cite{liang2022codepolicies} and semantic queries over code \\cite{sahu2022codequeriesdataset} demonstrates reasoning capabilities in programming contexts. Multimodal reasoning research, including \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense, smith2022constructvldatafree, liu2022deplotoneshot, cho2022dallevalprobing}, also highlights sophisticated reasoning over diverse data types. The design of circular air intakes for turbofans involves significant mathematical modeling \\cite{tsukanov2022designcircular}.\n\nDespite these successes, several challenges and research gaps remain prominent. \\textextbf{Robustness} is a critical concern, as highlighted by studies demonstrating that models can still rely on superficial cues rather than deep understanding \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Ensuring true mathematical reasoning, rather than mimicry, requires models that are resilient to variations in problem presentation and robust against adversarial manipulations \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Research on achieving out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} and understanding the causal underpinnings of reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, willig2022foundationmodels, li2022counterfactualreasoning, tian2022debiasingmodels} is essential to address this. The analysis of student self-assessment accuracy also points to robustness concerns in educational contexts \\cite{markta2022accuracypupils}.\n\n\\textextbf{Generalization to novel mathematical concepts and abstract reasoning} remains a significant hurdle \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. While current models excel in well-defined problem spaces, their ability to perform advanced theoretical reasoning, discover new mathematical principles, or adapt to entirely new domains is limited. Bridging this gap might involve deeper integration of structured knowledge \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge} and potentially new neuro-symbolic architectures \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}. The BIG-bench benchmark aims to quantify and extrapolate capabilities beyond imitation \\cite{srivastava2022beyondimitation}, highlighting areas where current models fall short. The limitations of retriever-augmented language models in reasoning are also noted \\cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Computer simulation of intelligent control systems \\cite{khuralay2022computersimulation} and the use of hybrid algorithms for complex problems \\cite{wang2022hybridgenetic, snchez2022clusteringapproach} also point to the challenges of generalization in applied domains. The performance of current models on Arabic reading comprehension datasets is also explored \\cite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. Differentiable reasoning over long stories assesses systematic generalization \\cite{li2022differentiablereasoning}.\n\n\\textextbf{Interpretability and explainability} of AI reasoning processes are also areas demanding further investigation. While methods like CoT offer some transparency \\cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, understanding the internal decision-making mechanisms of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks is still an open problem. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and debugging efforts, particularly in critical applications. Characterizing biases in NLP systems \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize} is intrinsically linked to interpretability, ensuring fairness and accountability. The use of NLP for classifying open-ended responses \\cite{wilson2022classificationopenended} and the development of interpretable methods for NER \\cite{chen2022btpkbasedlearning} are avenues towards better understanding model outputs. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria \\cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit} and the analysis of language change \\cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} also relate to understanding underlying processes. The suitability of current LLMs for ethical decisions is questioned due to interpretability issues \\cite{albrecht2022despitesuperhuman}.\n\nThe potential for \\textextbf{personalization} in AI-driven reasoning tools, inspired by work in vision-language models \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn} and applied to areas like education \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration, markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics, xiao2022auxiliaryteaching, nuraina2022desainbahan}, offers exciting possibilities. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven assessments \\cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}, must be carefully addressed. The analysis of correlation between academic performance and learning motivation \\cite{yu2022analysiscorrelation} further contextualizes educational applications. Creative mathematical reasoning's relation to cognitive motivation \\cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical} and the critical analysis of big data applications \\cite{kumar2022criticalanalysis} also touch upon these areas.\n\nFurthermore, the study of \\textextbf{foundational aspects of logic and reasoning} continues to inform AI development. Semiotic analyses of logic systems \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis} and explorations of ontological commitment \\cite{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy} provide philosophical grounding. Research into information-theoretic scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} and comparisons of different algorithmic approaches \\cite{wankmller2022comparisonapproaches, wang2022comparisonthree, hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages} offer insights into optimizing AI systems. The benchmarking of various approaches, from spatial relationships in image generation \\cite{gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial} to ACOPF solutions \\cite{gopinath2022benchmarkinglargescale}, further contextualizes the performance and limitations of current AI systems. Computational stability and program testing are examined \\cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment}. Cross-lingual speaker identification \\cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker} and CrunchQA dataset for knowledge graph reasoning \\cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic} represent specific domains of investigation.\n\nFuture research should focus on developing AI systems that exhibit deeper understanding, greater robustness, and more profound generalization capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. This includes exploring novel neuro-symbolic architectures \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}, refining hybrid reasoning approaches \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture genuine reasoning skills rather than surface-level correlations \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial}. The development of executable formal models \\cite{khan2022executableformal} and experimentation frameworks \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework} will be crucial for verifying the correctness of AI-generated reasoning. The investigation into the interplay between retriever and language models for reasoning is also a promising direction \\cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Understanding the computational experiment process \\cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment} and leveraging data-free continual learning strategies \\cite{smith2022constructvldatafree} are also important future directions. Continual learning on 3D point clouds \\cite{zamorski2022continuallearning} and the analysis of language change \\cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} offer further avenues for advancement.\n",
