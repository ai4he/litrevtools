  "introduction": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, from text generation to complex question answering \\cite{brown2020language}. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are increasingly being applied is mathematical reasoning. The ability to understand, process, and generate mathematical content is fundamental to scientific discovery, engineering, finance, and many aspects of daily life. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of robust mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing goal in the field of AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The systematic analysis of reasoning processes, whether in natural language \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, yu2022analysiscorrelation}, formal logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis}, or applied domains like clinical reasoning \\cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}, is crucial for advancing AI capabilities.\n\nRecent advancements in LLMs, particularly those based on transformer architectures \\cite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened new avenues for tackling complex mathematical problems. These models, trained on massive datasets, possess an emergent ability to perform arithmetic operations, solve algebraic equations, and even engage with more abstract mathematical concepts \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remain active areas of research. Issues such as susceptibility to superficial patterns in problem descriptions \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}, the need for explicit reasoning capabilities \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}, and challenges in out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} highlight the ongoing challenges. The development of AI-assisted programming further underscores the integration of AI with structured problem-solving \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}. Furthermore, understanding the information-theoretic aspects of neural scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} and developing frameworks for formal methods \\cite{khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework} are critical for advancing rigorous reasoning systems.\n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research at the intersection of large language models, mathematical reasoning, and related AI reasoning techniques. We address the following research questions:\n\n1. What are the primary tasks and datasets used to evaluate AI models in mathematical and logical reasoning?\n2. What are the dominant methodologies and architectures employed to enhance AI reasoning performance?\n3. What are the key findings and limitations of current research in this area, including aspects of robustness, generalization, and interpretability?\n4. What are the promising future research directions for AI in mathematical and logical reasoning?\n\nTo address these questions, we conducted a systematic search of the literature. Our methodology, detailed in the following section, adheres to the principles of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement \\cite{moher2009preferred} to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We focused on original research articles that specifically investigated the application of LLMs and related AI techniques to mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. This includes studies on multimodal sentiment analysis \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased}, educational assessment \\cite{markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics}, and the development of specific reasoning frameworks \\cite{yu2022alertadapt, stolfo2022causalframework}.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details our methodology. Section 3 presents the results of our literature search, organized thematically. Section 4 discusses the findings, identifies research gaps, and outlines implications and future directions. Finally, Section 5 concludes the review by summarizing the key contributions and insights.",

These can be broadly categorized as follows:\n\n*   **Arithmetic, Algebraic, and Mathematical Word Problems:** These tasks form the core of quantitative reasoning evaluations. Datasets like GSM8K and MATH \\cite{kobelski2022rethinking, hendrycks2021math} are frequently used to assess LLMs' ability to perform calculations, solve equations, and interpret natural language descriptions of mathematical scenarios. Surveys such as \\cite{lu2022surveydeep} provide a comprehensive overview of these tasks and associated datasets. Datasets like ArMATH are specifically designed for Arabic math word problems \\cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset}.\n*   **Commonsense and Multimodal Reasoning:** Reasoning extends beyond pure mathematics to include everyday knowledge. Commonsense reasoning tasks are often evaluated using datasets that require understanding implicit information \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Multimodal sentiment analysis, which involves logical reasoning and mathematical operations on different data types (text, audio), is another area of focus \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased}.\n*   **Formal Methods, Logic, and Verification:** While not always directly involving LLMs, research in formal logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis}, executable formal models \\cite{khan2022executableformal}, and experimentation frameworks for specification and verification \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework} provide foundational principles for rigorous reasoning. These areas explore how to ensure correctness and analyze system properties, which can inform the development of more reliable AI reasoning systems.\n*   **Causal Reasoning and Robustness:** Understanding the causal relationships within problem statements is crucial for robust reasoning. Frameworks for quantifying the robustness of mathematical reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} and achieving out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} are key areas of investigation.\n*   **Educational Assessment and Learning Analytics:** Studies assess quantitative literacy \\cite{zimmerman2022assessingphysics}, mathematical thinking abilities \\cite{shidqiya2022analysisstudents}, and learning difficulties in mathematics \\cite{amaliyah2022analisiskesulitan}. The accuracy of self-assessment in subjects like mathematics is also explored \\cite{markta2022accuracypupils}. Research on learning analytics considers expected usefulness and privacy concerns \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration}.\n\n\\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}\n\nResearchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:\n\n\\subsubsection{Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning}\n\nTechniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \\cite{wei2022chainofthought}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \\cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \\cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \\cite{kar2022arggenprompting}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation}\n\nFine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalizing frozen vision-language representations addresses user-specific concepts through language \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Integration of External Tools and Knowledge}\n\nHybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \\cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Vadalog is a system designed for reasoning over large knowledge graphs \\cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Formal Methods and Structured Reasoning}\n\nFormal methods are employed to ensure rigor and correctness. Petri nets enhance clinical reasoning \\cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}. Executable formal models, such as for VHDL \\cite{khan2022executableformal}, enable formal reasoning about designs. Experimentation frameworks for web service verification use declarative, mathematical formalisms \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework}. A semiotic analysis assesses the usefulness and limitations of multiple systems of logic \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Causal Reasoning, Robustness, and Generalization}\n\nEnsuring model robustness is a key concern. Causal frameworks help understand the influence of different input factors on model output, preventing reliance on spurious correlations \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Achieving and understanding out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in systematic reasoning is investigated using small-scale transformers \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding}. Autoformalization for neural theorem proving aims to bridge the gap between neural and formal methods \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Hybrid Algorithms and Optimization in Applied Domains}\n\nHybrid algorithms are used for optimization in complex domains. A hybrid genetic algorithm addresses the flexible job shop scheduling problem \\cite{wang2022hybridgenetic}. Clustering strategies optimize the siting of recharging stations for electric vehicles \\cite{snchez2022clusteringapproach}. Updates to thermal error compensation models via on-machine measurement demonstrate adaptive modeling \\cite{mare2022updatethermal}. Three-flow fusion technology is applied in thermal power digital twins \\cite{zhou2022applicationthreeflow}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Analysis of Reasoning and Understanding}\n\nResearch delves into the nature of reasoning itself. A ratiocinative study examines W. V. O. Quine's criterion of ontological commitment \\cite{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy}. AFR-BERT is a multimodal sentiment analysis model that fuses features using attention mechanisms for emotional analysis through logical reasoning \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased}. AI-assisted programming integrates AI with structured problem-solving \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Educational and Assessment Contexts}\n\nStudies investigate the accuracy of pupils' self-assessment in mathematics and language \\cite{markta2022accuracypupils}. Learning analytics adoption is explored through scenario-based studies \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration}. Mathematical thinking abilities in students are analyzed in terms of self-efficacy \\cite{shidqiya2022analysisstudents}. The algorithm method is examined for teaching Russian \\cite{2022algorithmmethod}. Assessing physics quantitative literacy involves adapting reasoning inventories \\cite{zimmerman2022assessingphysics}. Academic recovery of students is assessed using test data \\cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Bias and Fairness in NLP}\n\nMethodologies are developed to characterize bias and harmful stereotypes in NLP, emphasizing collaborative approaches \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize}. This is crucial for ensuring equitable AI applications, including those involving quantitative reasoning.\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison of Approaches and Model Transformations}\n\nStudies compare different methods for classification \\cite{wankmller2022comparisonapproaches}, covariate effects in latent factors \\cite{wang2022comparisonthree}, and model transformation languages \\cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}. A review covers named entity recognition technology for aeronautical information intelligence \\cite{mi2022reviewdevelopment}. Information-theoretic analysis of compute-optimal neural scaling laws provides insights into model and data size trade-offs \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Attributed Text Generation}\n\nAttributed text generation via post-hoc research and revision is explored, focusing on generating text that is grounded in external information \\cite{gao2022attributedtext}.",
  "discussion": "\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe collected 45 papers reveal a dynamic and rapidly evolving research landscape at the nexus of AI, particularly LLMs, and structured reasoning, including mathematical and logical domains. The findings underscore significant progress in AI's ability to perform quantitative tasks, ranging from basic arithmetic and algebraic problem-solving \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking} to more complex mathematical word problems \\cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset}. Methodologies such as chain-of-thought prompting \\cite{wei2022chainofthought}, fine-tuning on specialized datasets \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}, and the integration of external knowledge sources \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation} have been pivotal in achieving these advancements.\n\nA recurring theme is the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques like CoT for eliciting step-by-step reasoning \\cite{yu2022alertadapt}. This moves beyond mere pattern matching towards more transparent problem-solving processes. The combination of LLMs with formal methods, symbolic solvers, and knowledge graphs represents a powerful paradigm for leveraging the strengths of both neural and symbolic AI \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework}. The development of systems like Vadalog for knowledge graph reasoning \\cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog} further exemplifies this trend.\n\nDespite these successes, several challenges and research gaps remain prominent. **Robustness** is a critical concern, as highlighted by studies demonstrating that models can still rely on superficial cues rather than deep understanding \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Ensuring true mathematical reasoning, rather than mimicry, requires models that are resilient to variations in problem presentation and robust against adversarial manipulations \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Research on achieving out-of-distribution generalization \\cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} and understanding the causal underpinnings of reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} is essential to address this.\n\n**Generalization to novel mathematical concepts and abstract reasoning** remains a significant hurdle \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. While current models excel in well-defined problem spaces, their ability to perform advanced theoretical reasoning, discover new mathematical principles, or adapt to entirely new domains is limited. Bridging this gap might involve deeper integration of structured knowledge \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge} and potentially new architectural innovations inspired by formal systems \\cite{khan2022executableformal}.\n\n**Interpretability and explainability** of AI reasoning processes are also areas demanding further investigation. While methods like CoT offer some transparency \\cite{wei2022chainofthought}, understanding the internal decision-making mechanisms of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks is still an open problem. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and debugging efforts, particularly in critical applications. Characterizing biases in NLP systems \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize} is intrinsically linked to interpretability, ensuring fairness and accountability.\n\nThe potential for **personalization** in AI-driven reasoning tools, inspired by work in vision-language models \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn} and applied to areas like education \\cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration, markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics}, offers exciting possibilities. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven assessments \\cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}, must be carefully addressed.\n\nFurthermore, the study of **foundational aspects of logic and reasoning** continues to inform AI development. Semiotic analyses of logic systems \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis} and explorations of ontological commitment \\cite{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy} provide philosophical grounding. Research into information-theoretic scaling laws \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} and comparisons of different algorithmic approaches \\cite{wankmller2022comparisonapproaches, wang2022comparisonthree, hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages} offer insights into optimizing AI systems.\n\nFuture research should focus on developing AI systems that exhibit deeper understanding, greater robustness, and more profound generalization capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. This includes exploring novel neuro-symbolic architectures \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural}, refining hybrid reasoning approaches \\cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture genuine reasoning skills rather than surface-level correlations \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. The advancement of executable formal models \\cite{khan2022executableformal} and experimentation frameworks \\cite{katra2022experimentationframework} will be crucial for verifying the correctness of AI-generated reasoning.\n\nIn summary, while AI, particularly LLMs, has made remarkable strides in quantitative and logical reasoning tasks, the path toward truly intelligent and trustworthy systems requires continued innovation in robustness, generalization, interpretability, and the integration of diverse AI paradigms. The insights gleaned from multimodal analysis \\cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased} and applied domains like healthcare \\cite{tewes2022artificialintelligence} and engineering \\cite{snchez2022clusteringapproach, mare2022updatethermal, zhou2022applicationthreeflow} further emphasize the broad impact and ongoing development in this critical research area.",
