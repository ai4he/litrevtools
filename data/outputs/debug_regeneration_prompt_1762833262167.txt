  abstract={Large Vision&Language models pretrained on web-scale data provide representations that are invaluable for numerous V&L problems. However, it is unclear how they can be used for reasoning about user-specific visual concepts in unstructured language. This problem arises in multiple domains, from personalized image retrieval to personalized interaction with smart devices. We introduce a new learning setup called Personalized Vision&Language (PerVL) with two new benchmark datasets for retrieving and segmenting user-specific"personalized"concepts"in the wild". In PerVL, one should learn personalized concepts (1) independently of the downstream task (2) allowing a pretrained model to reason about them with free language, and (3) does not require personalized negative examples. We propose an architecture for solving PerVL that operates by extending the input vocabulary of a pretrained model with new word embeddings for the new personalized concepts. The model can then reason about them by simply using them in a sentence. We demonstrate that our approach learns personalized visual concepts from a few examples and can effectively apply them in image retrieval and semantic segmentation using rich textual queries.}

  abstract={We have recently witnessed a number of impressive results on hard mathematical reasoning problems with language models. At the same time, the robustness of these models has also been called into question; recent works have shown that models can rely on shallow patterns in the problem description when generating a solution.Building on the idea of behavioral testing, we propose a novel framework, which pins down the causal effect of various factors in the input, e.g., the surface form of the problem text, the operands, and math operators on the output solution.By grounding the behavioral analysis in a causal graph describing an intuitive reasoning process, we study the behavior of language models in terms of robustness and sensitivity to direct interventions in the input space. We apply our framework on a test bed of math word problems.Our analysis shows that robustness does not appear to continuously improve as a function of size, but the GPT-3 Davinci models (175B) achieve a dramatic improvement in both robustness and sensitivity compared to all other GPT variants.}

  abstract={Transportation has been incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) progressively. EVs do not produce air or noise pollution, and they have high energy efficiency and low maintenance costs. In this context, the development of efficient techniques to overcome the vehicle routing problem becomes crucial with the proliferation of EVs. The vehicle routing problem concerns the freight capacity and battery autonomy limitations in different delivery-service scenarios, and the challenge of best locating recharging stations. This work proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve the electric location routing problem with time windows (E-LRPTW) considering the state of charge, freight and battery capacities, and customer time windows in the decision model. A clustering strategy based on the k-means algorithm is proposed to divide the set of vertices (EVs) into small areas and define potential sites for recharging stations, while reducing the number of binary variables. The proposed model for E-LRPTW was implemented in Python and solved using mathematical modeling language AMPL together with CPLEX. Performed tests on instances with 5 and 10 clients showed a large reduction in the time required to find the solution (by about 60 times in one instance). It is concluded that the strategy of dividing customers by sectors has the potential to be applied and generate solutions for larger geographical areas and numbers of recharging stations, and determine recharging station locations as part of planning decisions in more realistic scenarios.}

In this paper, the mathematical model of flexible job shop scheduling is established with the goal of minimizing the maximum completion time (makespan). It combines the local search ability of simu-lated annealing algorithm and the global search ability of ge-netic algorithm. In the process of chromosome decoding, greedy decoding method is used to get a better scheduling solution as far as possible. The hybrid scheduling algorithm is implemented based on Visual Studio and C # language. Finally, 8×8 classic scheduling instance are used for simulation scheduling experiments to verify that the hybrid genetic algorithm proposed in this paper is effective in solving large-scale FJSP.}

  abstract={Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a challenging multimodal task involving several research fields such as vision, cognition, and reasoning, which combines images and natural language for reasoning. Existing VCR methods focus on global attention or use pre-training models, but these methods lack attention to local features of visual and language. In this paper, a multi-layer attention network is proposed for the VCR task, including an intra-modal attention module and an inter-modal attention module. The intra-modal attention module complements important features of visual and language modalities with fine-grained visual attention to improve the relevance of visual and language. The inter-modal attention module captures the internal dependencies between visual and language. Finally, the two modules are integrated into an end-to-end reasoning framework. Experiments on the VCR large-scale dataset show that the proposed method exhibits a decent improvement in the VCR task and illustrates the effectiveness of the method on three subtasks.}

  abstract={Medical students are called to acquire competence to manage disease in its dynamic evolution over time, learning to analyze how clinical conditions evolve in a patient's history and how each condition interferes with the evolution of the other coexisting conditions. In this article, the health issue network (HIN) approach is introduced as a formal language based on Petri nets (PNs) to model properties that are particularly apposite for the graphical representation of HIN evolutionary paths. Moreover, the PNs’ underlying mathematical model allows users to draw coherent and well-formed graphs representing rather complex clinical cases. Finally, HIN can be easily integrated into a simulation environment to support case-based learning activities and assessment. The examples of the exercises provided in this article show, on the one hand, the ways the introduced methodology is figured out and implemented; on the other hand, they outline the variety of learning questions that users may deal with when deploying the HIN approach.}

@article{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy,
  title={A Ratiocinative Study and Assessment of W. V. O. Quine’s “Criterion of Ontological Commitment”},
  author={Joseph T. Ekong},
  year={2022},
  journal={International Journal of Philosophy},
  doi={10.47941/ijp.1052},
  url={https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b6955111d3bd91b13e7a9c7fbdfd75d43825c36},
  abstract={Purpose: This work has three main objectives: Firstly, it offers an elucidation of the notion of ontological commitment. Secondly, it assesses the adequacy of the criterion of ontological commitment for different languages. Thirdly, it offers some speculative and evaluative remarks regarding the significance of Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment. Many ontologists, within the analytic tradition, often appeal to Quine's criterion of ontological commitment, when debating whether an assertion or theory implies the existence of a certain entity. Regarding his goal in formulating this criterion, he says that the criterion does not aim to help us discover what it is that there is, but only what a theory says there is: “I look to variables and quantification for evidence as to what a theory says that there is, not for evidence as to what there is” (Quine, 1960: 225). Its most popular formulation, using textual evidence from Quine's oeuvre, is: “To be is to be the value of a bound variable,” (Quine, 1961: 15). However, this formulation is susceptible to gross misunderstanding, especially if one is influenced by the formalities and technical maneuvers of model theory. In mathematical logic, model theory is the study of the relationship between formal theories (a collection of sentences in a formal language expressing statements about a mathematical structure), and their models (those structures in which the statements of the theory hold). Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic where we study mathematical structures by considering the first-order sentences true in those structures and the sets definable by first-order formulas. Model theory studies the relations between sentences of a formal language and the interpretations (or ‘structures’) which make these sentences true or false. It offers precise definitions of truth, logical truth and consequence, meanings and modalities. 
Methodology: This work is expository, analytic, critical and evaluative in its methodology. Of course, there are familiar philosophical problems which are within the discursive framework of ‘ontology,’ often phrased by asking if something or some category of things are “real,” or whether “they exist,” concretely. An outstanding example is provided by the traditional problem of universals, which issues in the nominalist-realist controversy, as to the real existence of universals, or of abstract entities such as classes (in the mathematical sense) or propositions (in the abstract sense, referring to the content of an assertion in abstraction from the particular words used to convey it). 
Results: In as much as one might agree with Quine’s Criterion of Ontological Commitment, one might also opine that it is nonetheless a feature of first-order language (i.e. the language embodied in first-order logic; a symbolized reasoning process comprising relations, functions and constants, in which each sentence or statement is broken down into a subject and a predicate. In this regard, the predicate modifies or defines the properties of the subject) that there should be an exact correspondence between the ontological commitments carried by a sentence and the objects that must be counted among the values of the variables in order for the sentence to be true. However, this in itself is not a reason for thinking that such a feature will generalize beyond first-order languages. It is possible for Quine’s Criterion to degenerate, when the language contains atomic predicates expressing extrinsic properties. 
Unique Contribution to theory, practice and policy: Based on Quine’s analysis, a theory is committed to those and only those entities that in the last analysis serve as the values of its bound variables. Thus, ordinary first-order theory commits one to an ontology only of individuals (particulars), whereas higher order logic commits one to the existence of sets, i.e. of collections of definite and distinct entities (or, alternatively, of properties and relations). Likewise, if bound first-order variables are assumed to range over sets (as they do in set theory), a commitment to the existence of these sets is incurred. Admittedly, the precise import of Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment, however, is not completely clear, nor is it clear in what other sense one is perhaps committed by a theory to those entities that are named or otherwise referred to in it, but not quantified over in it. However, it despite its limitations, it has made is possible for one to measure the ontological cost of theories, an important component in deciding which theories to accept, thus offering a partial foundation for theory choice.}

  abstract={Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.}

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of solving math problems and proving theorems in language has garnered significant interest in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. For example, mathematics serves as a testbed for aspects of reasoning that are challenging for powerful deep learning models, driving new algorithmic and modeling advances. On the other hand, recent advances in large-scale neural language models have opened up new benchmarks and opportunities to use deep learning for mathematical reasoning. In this survey paper, we review the key tasks, datasets, and methods at the intersection of mathematical reasoning and deep learning over the past decade. We also evaluate existing benchmarks and methods, and discuss future research directions in this domain.}

  abstract={Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) which are trained on large text corpus via self-supervised learning method, have yielded promising performance on various tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, though PLMs with huge parameters can effectively possess rich knowledge learned from massive training text and benefit downstream tasks at the fine-tuning stage, they still have some limitations such as poor reasoning ability due to the lack of external knowledge. Research has been dedicated to incorporating knowledge into PLMs to tackle these issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Knowledge Enhanced Pre-trained Language Models (KE-PLMs) to provide a clear insight into this thriving field. We introduce appropriate taxonomies respectively for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. For NLU, we divide the types of knowledge into four categories: linguistic knowledge, text knowledge, knowledge graph (KG), and rule knowledge. The KE-PLMs for NLG are categorized into KG-based and retrieval-based methods. Finally, we point out some promising future directions of KE-PLMs.}

  abstract={One of the first steps in many text-based social science studies is to retrieve documents that are relevant for an analysis from large corpora of otherwise irrelevant documents. The conventional approach in social science to address this retrieval task is to apply a set of keywords and to consider those documents to be relevant that contain at least one of the keywords. But the application of incomplete keyword lists has a high risk of drawing biased inferences. More complex and costly methods such as query expansion techniques, topic model-based classification rules, and active as well as passive supervised learning could have the potential to more accurately separate relevant from irrelevant documents and thereby reduce the potential size of bias. Yet, whether applying these more expensive approaches increases retrieval performance compared to keyword lists at all, and if so, by how much, is unclear as a comparison of these approaches is lacking. This study closes this gap by comparing these methods across three retrieval tasks associated with a data set of German tweets (Linder in SSRN, 2017. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3026393 ), the Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) (Sap et al. in Social bias frames: reasoning about social and power implications of language. In: Jurafsky et al. (eds) Proceedings of the 58th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics. Association for Computational Linguistics, p 5477–5490, 2020. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.aclmain.486 ), and the Reuters-21578 corpus (Lewis in Reuters-21578 (Distribution 1.0). [Data set], 1997. http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/ ). Results show that query expansion techniques and topic model-based classification rules in most studied settings tend to decrease rather than increase retrieval performance. Active supervised learning, however, if applied on a not too small set of labeled training instances (e.g. 1000 documents), reaches a substantially higher retrieval performance than keyword lists.}

  abstract={In educational and psychological research, it is common to use latent factors to represent constructs and then to examine covariate effects on these latent factors. Using empirical data, this study applied three approaches to covariate effects on latent factors: the multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) approach, multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) approach, and the structural equation model trees (SEM Trees) approach. The MIMIC approach directly models covariate effects on latent factors. The MG-CFA approach allows testing of measurement invariance before latent factor means could be compared. The more recently developed SEM Trees approach partitions the sample into homogenous subsets based on the covariate space; model parameters are estimated separately for each subgroup. We applied the three approaches using an empirical dataset extracted from the eighth-grade U.S. data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2019 database. All approaches suggested differences among mathematics achievement categories for the latent factor of mathematics self-concept. In addition, language spoken at home did not seem to affect students’ mathematics self-concept. Despite these general findings, the three approaches provided different pieces of information regarding covariate effects. For all models, we appropriately considered the complex data structure and sampling weights following recent recommendations for analyzing large-scale assessment data.}

  abstract={Automated decision-making systems, especially those based on natural language processing, are pervasive in our lives. They are not only behind the internet search engines we use daily, but also take more critical roles: selecting candidates for a job, determining suspects of a crime, diagnosing autism and more. Such automated systems make errors, which may be harmful in many ways, be it because of the severity of the consequences (as in health issues) or because of the sheer number of people they affect. When errors made by an automated system affect a population more than others, we call the system \textit{biased}. Most modern natural language technologies are based on artifacts obtained from enormous volumes of text using machine learning, namely language models and word embeddings. Since they are created by applying subsymbolic machine learning, mostly artificial neural networks, they are opaque and practically uninterpretable by direct inspection, thus making it very difficult to audit them. In this paper, we present a methodology that spells out how social scientists, domain experts, and machine learning experts can collaboratively explore biases and harmful stereotypes in word embeddings and large language models. Our methodology is based on the following principles: * focus on the linguistic manifestations of discrimination on word embeddings and language models, not on the mathematical properties of the models * reduce the technical barrier for discrimination experts%, be it social scientists, domain experts or other * characterize through a qualitative exploratory process in addition to a metric-based approach * address mitigation as part of the training process, not as an afterthought}

  abstract={While ion channels and transporters involved in excitation-contraction coupling have been linked and constructed as comprehensive computational models, validation of whether each individual component of a model can be reused has not been previously attempted. Here we address this issue while using a novel modular modeling approach to investigate the underlying mechanism for the differences between left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). Our model was developed from modules constructed using the module assembly principles of the CellML model markup language. The components of three existing separate models of cardiac function were disassembled as to create smaller modules, validated individually, and then the component parts were combined into a new integrative model of a rat ventricular myocyte. The model was implemented in OpenCOR using the CellML standard in order to ensure reproducibility. Simulated action potential (AP), Ca2+ transient, and tension were in close agreement with our experimental measurements: LV AP showed a prolonged duration and a more prominent plateau compared with RV AP; Ca2+ transient showed prolonged duration and slow decay in LV compared to RV; the peak value and relaxation of tension were larger and slower, respectively, in LV compared to RV. Our novel approach of module-based mathematical modeling has established that the ionic mechanisms underlying the APs and Ca2+ handling play a role in the variation in force production between ventricles. This simulation process also provides a useful way to reuse and elaborate upon existing models in order to develop a new model.}

  abstract={Abstract Tagmemic theory as a semiotic theory can be used to analyze multiple systems of logic and to assess their strengths and weaknesses. This analysis constitutes an application of semiotics and also a contribution to understanding of the nature of logic within the context of human meaning. Each system of logic is best adapted to represent one portion of human rationality. Acknowledging this correlation between systems and their targets helps explain the usefulness of more than one system. Among these systems, the two-valued system of classical logic takes its place. All the systems of logic can be incorporated into a complex mathematical model that has a place for each system and that represents a larger whole in human reasoning. The model can represent why tight formal systems of logic can be applied in some contexts with great success, but in other contexts are not directly applicable. The result suggests that human reasoning is innately richer than any one formal system of logic.}

The aim of the study was to analyze whether groups of pupils with different self-assessments of school tasks in the Czech language and mathematics (significant underestimation, adequate self-assessment, significant overestimation) differ in some of the cognitive skills studied. Our study questions were as follows: (1) Do pupils assess their achievements in particular school tasks accurately, or inaccurately? (2) Do pupils´ self-assessments differ in mathematics and language? (3) Do the pupil´s self-assessment correlate with individual parameters? The main tool used in the study was a didactic test on mathematics and a didactic test on the Czech language based on the Czech National Curricula Document and created by an expert team. In addition, Raven's Color Progressive Matrices (CPM), Similarities from the Wechsler Intelligence (WISC-SIM), and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) were used. Considering the nature of the data, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used. The present study is a part of the larger research project, involving 29 primary school classes, 657 pupils in total. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the accuracy of pupils' self-assessments is low, while the accuracy of pupils' self-assessments in mathematics and Czech language differs (in mathematics there are more children with more accurate estimates and more pupils who underestimate themselves, in Czech language there are more pupils who overestimate their performance. Statistically significant differences were observed in the domains of Raven's Color Progressive Matrices and Rey-Osterrieth Figure, and in terms of the focus of each test, it could be concluded that there are significant differences between the groups in the domain of non-verbal reasoning skills and in the domain of analytical and organizational perceptual activity and memory. In the area of verbal intellectual abilities, there were no significant differences between the groups.}

  abstract={Multimodal sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing which refers to the fact that machines can analyze and recognize emotions through logical reasoning and mathematical operations after learning multimodal emotional features. For the problem of how to consider the effective fusion of multimodal data and the relevance of multimodal data in multimodal sentiment analysis, we propose an attention-based mechanism feature relevance fusion multimodal sentiment analysis model (AFR-BERT). In the data pre-processing stage, text features are extracted using the pre-trained language model BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers), and the BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the internal information of the audio. In the data fusion phase, the multimodal data fusion network effectively fuses multimodal features through the interaction of text and audio information. During the data analysis phase, the multimodal data association network analyzes the data by exploring the correlation of fused information between text and audio. In the data output phase, the model outputs the results of multimodal sentiment analysis. We conducted extensive comparative experiments on the publicly available sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experimental results show that AFR-BERT improves on the classical multimodal sentiment analysis model in terms of relevant performance metrics. In addition, ablation experiments and example analysis show that the multimodal data analysis network in AFR-BERT can effectively capture and analyze the sentiment features in text and audio.}

  abstract={Recent advancements in large language models have enabled them to perform well on complex tasks that require step-by-step reasoning with few-shot learning. However, it is unclear whether these models are applying reasoning skills they have learnt during pre-training , or if they are simply memorizing their training corpus at finer granularity and have learnt to better understand their context.To address this question, we introduce {pasted macro ‘OUR’}model, a benchmark and suite of analyses for evaluating reasoning skills of language models. {pasted macro ‘OUR’}model enables comparing pre-trained and finetuned models on complex tasks that require reasoning skills to solve. Our benchmark provides a test bed to asses any language model on fine-grained reasoning skills, which spans over 20 datasets and covers 10 different reasoning skills. By using {pasted macro ‘OUR’}model we further investigate the role of finetuning. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that language models learn more reasoning skills such as textual entailment, abductive reasoning, and analogical reasoning during the finetuning stage compared to pretraining stage. However, we also find that when language models are finetuned they tend to overfit to the prompt template, which hurts the robustness of models causing generalization problems.}

Эффективному изучению русского языка в общеобразовательной школе зачастую препятствуют такие факторы, как плохая усидчивость, отсутствие интереса к предмету, билингвизм и другое. Метод алгоритмизированного представления правил русской орфографии и пунктуации способствует наилучшему усвоению учебного материала и позволяет повысить качество обучения русскому языку школьников среднего и старшего звена. Цель − обоснование эффективности метода алгоритма в обучении русскому языку детей общеобразовательных средних школ, рассмотрение примерных моделей обучающих алгоритмов. Материал и методы. В работе применялись теоретические методы (моделирование, анализ, синтез); эмпирические методы (наблюдение, сравнение, эксперимент). Результаты и обсуждение. Простое заучивание правил не всегда приводит к повышению грамотности учащихся. Метод алгоритма предусматривает совместное с учениками составление алгоритмизированных схем различных видов, которые иллюстрируют изучаемое правило, позволяют пошагово отработать механизм рассуждения при выполнении орфографических и пунктуационных заданий. Такой подход способствует достижению высокого качества знаний путем систематической отработки практических навыков с помощью схем, адаптируемых под потребности каждого ребенка. Обучающий алгоритм может иметь разные виды: от четко сформулированной схемы (похожей на математический пример) до красочной иллюстрации, которая будет понятна детям с творческими способностями. Заключение. Метод алгоритма применяют для изучения практически любого правила русской орфографии и пунктуации. В созданной совместно с учащимися схеме должно быть отведено место для исключений и для примеров, которые ребенок впишет самостоятельно. При создании обучающей схемы школьник является активным соавтором. Схема никогда не является замкнутой системой. Она дорабатывается и совершенствуется в процессе практической деятельности учащихся. У детей из одного класса схемы могут быть совершенно различны, так как усовершенствованы и доработаны самостоятельно под руководством учителя.
 Introduction. Teaching Russian in secondary school, speech development and the formation of spelling and punctuation skills is an important task that involves a number of difficulties. Effective study of the Russian language in a secondary school is often hindered by factors such as poor perseverance, lack of interest in the subject, bilingualism, and more. Russian Russian spelling rules algorithmized representation method is considered in this paper, which allows to improve the quality of teaching Russian to middle and senior school students. The purpose is to substantiate the effectiveness of the algorithm method in teaching the Russian language to children of secondary schools, to consider approximate models of training algorithms. Material and methods. Theoretical methods (modeling, analysis, synthesis) were used in the work; empirical methods (observation, comparison, experiment). Results and discussion. Simple memorizing of the rules does not always lead to increased literacy of students. The algorithm method provides for the joint compilation of algorithmic schemes of various types with students, which illustrate the rule being studied, allow you to work out the mechanism of reasoning step by step when performing spelling and punctuation tasks. This approach contributes to the achievement of a high quality of knowledge through the systematic development of practical skills with the help of schemes adapted to the needs of each child. The training algorithm can have different types: from a clearly formulated scheme (similar to a mathematical example) up to a colorful illustration that will be understandable to children with creative abilities. Conclusion. The algorithm method can be applied to study almost any rule of Russian spelling and punctuation. In the scheme created jointly with the students, there should be a place for exceptions and for examples that the child will enter independently. When creating a training scheme, the student is an active co-author. A circuit is never a closed system. It is being refined and improved in the process of practical activity of students. For children from the same class, the schemes can be completely different, as they have been improved and finalized independently.}

However, a pretrained and nonadaptive model may not be accurate and robust enough for long-term application. This research presents a transfer function based thermal error compensation model updated via on-machine measurement. A mathematical model is implemented into the machine management software of a large horizontal machining centre to compensate for thermal errors in real time using C#/C++ programming language. The results show that after the thermal error compensation model is updated via on-machine measurement, the prediction accuracy, measured as peak-to-peak values, and the normalized root mean squared error are significantly improved. The prediction accuracy of the compensation model updated via on-machine measurement strongly depends on the sampling interval of the on machine measurements.}

  abstract={Out-of-distribution generalization (OODG) is a longstanding challenge for neural networks. This challenge is quite apparent in tasks with well-defined variables and rules, where explicit use of the rules could solve problems independently of the particular values of the variables, but networks tend to be tied to the range of values sampled in their training data. Large transformer-based language models have pushed the boundaries on how well neural networks can solve previously unseen problems, but their complexity and lack of clarity about the relevant content in their training data obfuscates how they achieve such robustness. As a step toward understanding how transformer-based systems generalize, we explore the question of OODG in small scale transformers trained with examples from a known distribution. Using a reasoning task based on the puzzle Sudoku, we show that OODG can occur on a complex problem if the training set includes examples sampled from the whole distribution of simpler component tasks. Successful generalization depends on carefully managing positional alignment when absolute position encoding is used, but we find that suppressing sensitivity to absolute positions overcomes this limitation. Taken together our results represent a small step toward understanding and promoting systematic generalization in transformers.}

Model transformation languages, developed for this task, are touted with many benefits over general purpose programming languages. However, a large number of these claims have not yet been substantiated. They are also made without the context necessary to be able to critically assess their merit or built meaningful empirical studies around them. The objective of our work is to elicit the reasoning, influences and background knowledge that lead people to assume benefits or drawbacks of model transformation languages. We conducted a large-scale interview study involving 56 participants from research and industry. Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation languages and were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof. We qualitatively analysed the responses to find factors that influence the properties of model transformation languages as well as explanations as to how exactly they do so. Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of GPLs, domain specific capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong influences on how people view properties of model transformation languages. Moreover, the Choice of MTL, the Use Case for which a transformation should be developed as well as the Skill s of involved stakeholders have a moderating effect on the influences, by changing the context to consider. There is a broad body of experience, that suggests positive and negative influences for properties of MTLs. Our data suggests, that much needs to be done in order to convey the viability of model transformation languages. Efforts to provide more empirical substance need to be undergone and lacklustre language capabilities and tooling need to be improved upon. We suggest several approaches for this that can be based on the results of the presented study.}

  abstract={Language models built using semi-supervised machine learning on large corpora of natural language have very quickly enveloped the fields of natural language generation and understanding. In this paper we apply a zero-shot approach independently developed by a number of researchers now gaining recognition as a significant alternative to fine-tuning for evaluation on common sense tasks. A language model with relatively few parameters and training steps compared to a more recent language model (T5) can outperform it on a recent large data set (TimeDial), while displaying robustness in its performance across a similar class of language tasks. Surprisingly, this result is achieved by using a hyperparameter-free zero-shot method with the smaller model, compared to fine-tuning to the larger model. We argue that robustness of the smaller model ought to be understood in terms of compositionality, in a sense that we draw from recent literature on a class of similar models. We identify a practical cost for our method and model: high GPU-time for natural language evaluation. The zero-shot measurement technique that produces remarkable stability, both for ALBERT and other BERT variants, is an application of pseudo-log-likelihoods to masked language models for the relative measurement of probability for substitution alternatives in forced choice language tasks such as the Winograd Schema Challenge, Winogrande, and others. One contribution of this paper is to bring together a number of similar, but independent strands of research. We produce some absolute state-of-the-art results for common sense reasoning in binary choice tasks, performing better than any published result in the literature, including fine-tuned efforts. We show a remarkable consistency of the model's performance under adversarial settings, which we argue is best explained by the model's compositionality of representations.}

  abstract={Self-supervision based on the information extracted from large knowledge graphs has been shown to improve the generalization of language models, in zero-shot evaluation on various downstream language reasoning tasks. Since these improvements are reported in aggregate, however, little is known about (i) how to select the appropriate knowledge for solid performance across tasks, (ii) how to combine this knowledge with neural language models, and (iii) how these pairings affect granular task performance. In this paper, we study the effect of knowledge sampling strategies and sizes that can be used to generate synthetic data for adapting language models. We study the effect of different synthetic datasets on language models with various architectures and sizes. The resulting models are evaluated against four task properties: domain overlap, answer similarity, vocabulary overlap, and answer length. Our experiments show that encoder-decoder models benefit from more data to learn from, whereas sampling strategies that balance across different aspects yield best performance. Most of the improvement occurs on questions with short answers and dissimilar answer candidates, which corresponds to the characteristics of the data used for pre-training.}

  abstract={In the hardware design process, hardware components are usually described in a hardware description language. Most of the hardware description languages, such as Verilog and VHDL, do not have mathematical foundation and hence are not fit for formal reasoning about the design. To enable formal reasoning in one of the most commonly used description language VHDL, we define a formal model of the VHDL language in Isabelle/HOL. Our model targets the functional part of VHDL designs used in industry, specifically the design of the LEON3 processor's integer unit. We cover a wide range of features in the VHDL language that are usually not modelled in the literature and define a novel operational semantics for it. Furthermore, our model can be exported to OCaml code for execution, turning the formal model into a VHDL simulator. We have tested our simulator against simple designs used in the literature, as well as the div32 module in the LEON3 design.

Our result suggests a linear relation similar to that supported by the empirical analysis of chinchilla. While that work studies transformer-based large language models trained on the MassiveText corpus gopher, as a starting point for development of a mathematical theory, we focus on a simpler learning model and data generating process, each based on a neural network with a sigmoidal output unit and single hidden layer of ReLU activation units. We introduce general error upper bounds for a class of algorithms which incrementally update a statistic (for example gradient descent). For a particular learning model inspired by barron 1993, we establish an upper bound on the minimal information-theoretically achievable expected error as a function of model and data set sizes. We then derive allocations of computation that minimize this bound. We present empirical results which suggest that this approximation correctly identifies an asymptotic linear compute-optimal scaling. This approximation also generates new insights. Among other things, it suggests that, as the input dimension or latent space complexity grows, as might be the case for example if a longer history of tokens is taken as input to a language model, a larger fraction of the compute budget should be allocated to growing the learning model rather than training data.}

  abstract={To explore the correlation between academic performance and learning motivation in English course under a corpus-data-driven blended teaching model, this study set research objects as 62 year-2020-enrolled undergraduate students majoring in English from a university in Jinan City, Shandong Province, eastern China. According to their previous frequencies of using information technology to learn English, these 62 students were divided into two groups: practice group with high frequency and control group with low frequency, with 31 students in each group. The two groups of students were taught 3 English lessons per week for a total of 15 weeks by the exact same teachers using a corpus-data-driven blended teaching model. The students’ English academic performances were assessed by well-organized final tests, and their English learning motivations were measured by a motivation scale and questionnaires. The results show that the correlation coefficients between the average score of motivation questionnaires, intrinsic motivation factors, extrinsic motivation factors, and the average score of academic performances in practice group were 0.894, 0.682, and 0.724, respectively, while those in control group were 0.749, 0.836, and 0.904. In all the above correlation analyses, the significance level is 0.01, and all coefficient values are higher than critical value. Hence, there is a positive correlation between learning motivation and academic performance of the two groups of subjects. It is found that the corpus-data-driven blended teaching model has a significant impact on college students’ English academic performance and learning motivation, and it has a positive effect on the improvement of their English academic performance and the cultivation of learning motivation. In general, the key to this teaching model lies in reasoning and acquisition by analyzing the language provided by the corpus, and the whole process of data-driven learning is student-centered. Students are exposed to a large number of authentic language knowledge and cultural information, which promotes the sensitivity to relevant points. The results of this paper provide a reference for further research on the analysis of the correlation between academic performance and learning motivation in English course under the corpus-data-driven blended teaching model.}

  abstract={Pre-trained language models have recently shown that training on large corpora using the language modeling objective enables few-shot and zero-shot capabilities on a variety of NLP tasks, including commonsense reasoning tasks. This is achieved using text interactions with the model, usually by posing the task as a natural language text completion problem. While using language model probabilities to obtain task specific scores has been generally useful, it often requires task-specific heuristics such as length normalization, or probability calibration. In this work, we consider the question answering format, where we need to choose from a set of (free-form) textual choices of unspecified lengths given a context. We present ALC (Answer-Level Calibration), where our main suggestion is to model context-independent biases in terms of the probability of a choice without the associated context and to subsequently remove it using an unsupervised estimate of similarity with the full context. We show that our unsupervised answer-level calibration consistently improves over or is competitive with baselines using standard evaluation metrics on a variety of tasks including commonsense reasoning tasks. Further, we show that popular datasets potentially favor models biased towards easy cues which are available independent of the context. We analyze such biases using an associated F1-score. Our analysis indicates that answer-level calibration is able to remove such biases and leads to a more robust measure of model capability.}

MWorks is a multidomain unified modeling and simulation platform based on the Modelica language. In this study, MWorks is used to realize the modeling of multidomain systems, including electrical, thermal, mechanical, fluid, and heat transfer, in power plants. The test, calibration, verification, parameter optimization, and fault diagnosis of the thermal power plant mathematical models, which are historical and real-time data-driven, are discussed.

  abstract={Most of the existing discourse-level Information Extraction tasks have been modeled to be extractive in nature. However, we argue that extracting information from larger bodies of discourse-like documents requires more natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. In our work, we propose the novel task of document-level event argument aggregation which generates consolidated event-arguments at a document-level with minimal loss of information. More specifically, we focus on generating precise document-level information frames in a multilingual setting using prompt-based methods. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of prompt-based text generation approach to generate document-level argument spans in a low-resource and zero-shot setting. We also release the first of its kind multilingual event argument aggregation dataset that can be lever-aged in other related multilingual text generation tasks as well: https://github.com/}

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to speed up the exponential growth of cutting-edge technology, much way the Internet did. Due to intense competition from the private sector, governments, and businesspeople around the world, the Internet has already reached its peak as an exponential technology. In contrast, artificial intelligence is still in its infancy, and people all over the world are unsure of how it will impact their lives in the future. Artificial intelligence, is a field of technology that enables robots and computer programmes to mimic human intellect by teaching a predetermined set of software rules to learn by repetitive learning from experience and slowly moving toward maximum performance. Although this intelligence is still developing, it has already demonstrated five different levels of independence. Utilized initially to resolve issues. Next, think about solutions. Third, respond to inquiries. Fourth, use data analytics to generate forecasts. Fifth, make tactical recommendations. Massive data sets and "iterative algorithms," which use lookup tables and other data structures like stacks and queues to solve issues, make all of this possible. Iteration is a strategy where software rules are regularly adjusted to patterns in the data for a certain number of iterations. The artificial intelligence continuously makes small, incremental improvements that result in exponential growth, which enables the computer to become incredibly proficient at whatever it is trained to do. For each round of data processing, the artificial intelligence tests and measures its performance to develop new expertise. In order to address complicated problems, artificial intelligence aims to create computer systems that can mimic human behavior and exhibit human-like thought processes [1]. Artificial intelligence technology is being developed to give individualized medication in the field of healthcare. By 2030, six different artificial intelligence sectors will have considerably improved healthcare delivery through the utilization of larger, more accessible data sets. The first is machine learning. This area of artificial intelligence learns automatically and produces improved results based on identifying patterns in the data, gaining new insights, and enhancing the outcomes of whatever activity the system is intended to accomplish. It does this without being trained to learn a particular topic. Here are several instances of machine learning in the healthcare industry. The first is the IBM Watson Genomics, which aids in rapid disease diagnosis and identification by fusing cognitive computing with genome-based tumour sequencing. Second, a project called Nave Bayes allows for the prediction of diabetes years before an official diagnosis, before it results in harm to the kidneys, the heart, and the nerves. Third, employing two machine learning approaches termed classification and clustering to analyse the Indian Liver Patient Data (ILPD) set in order to predict liver illness before this organ that regulates metabolism becomes susceptible to chronic hepatitis, liver cancer, and cirrhosis [2]. Second, deep learning. Deep learning employs artificial intelligence to learn from data processing, much like machine learning does. Deep learning, on the other hand, makes use of synthetic neural networks that mimic human brain function to analyse data, identify relationships between the data, and provide outputs based on positive and negative reinforcement. For instance, in the fields of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT), deep learning aids in the processes of picture recognition and object detection. Deep learning algorithms for the early identification of Alzheimer's, diabetic retinopathy, and breast nodule ultrasound detection are three applications of this cutting-edge technology in the real world. Future developments in deep learning will make considerable improvements in pathology and radiology pictures [3]. Third, neural networks. The artificial intelligence system can now accept massive data sets, find patterns within the data, and respond to queries regarding the information processed because the computer learning process resembles a network of neurons in the human brain. Let's examine a few application examples that are now applicable to the healthcare sector. According to studies from John Hopkins University, surgical errors are a major contributor to medical malpractice claims since they happen more than 4,000 times a year in just the United States due to the human error of surgeons. Neural networks can be used in robot-assisted surgery to model and plan procedures, evaluate the abilities of the surgeon, and streamline surgical activities. In one study of 379 orthopaedic patients, it was discovered that robotic surgery using neural networks results in five times fewer complications than surgery performed by a single surgeon. Another application of neural networks is in visualising diagnostics, which was proven to physicians by Harvard University researchers who inserted an image of a gorilla to x-rays. Of the radiologists who saw the images, 83% did not recognise the gorilla. The Houston Medical Research Institute has created a breast cancer early detection programme that can analyse mammograms with 99 percent accuracy and offer diagnostic information 30 times faster than a human [4]. Cognitive computing is the fourth. Aims to replicate the way people and machines interact, showing how a computer may operate like the human brain when handling challenging tasks like text, speech, or image analysis. Large volumes of patient data have been analysed, with the majority of the research to date focusing on cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Companies like Google, IBM, Facebook, and Apple have shown interest in this work. Cognitive computing made up the greatest component of the artificial market in 2020, with 39% of the total [5]. Hospitals made up 42% of the market for cognitive computing end users because of the rising demand for individualised medical data. IBM invested more than $1 billion on the development of the WATSON analytics platform ecosystem and collaboration with startups committed to creating various cloud and application-based systems for the healthcare business in 2014 because it predicted the demand for cognitive computing in this sector. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the fifth. This area of artificial intelligence enables computers to comprehend and analyse spoken language. The initial phase of this pre-processing is to divide the data up into more manageable semantic units, which merely makes the information simpler for the NLP system to understand. Clinical trial development is experiencing exponential expansion in the healthcare sector thanks to NLP. First, the NLP uses speech-to-text dictation and structured data entry to extract clinical data at the point of care, reducing the need for manual assessment of complex clinical paperwork. Second, using NLP technology, healthcare professionals can automatically examine enormous amounts of unstructured clinical and patient data to select the most suitable patients for clinical trials, perhaps leading to an improvement in the patients' health [6]. Computer vision comes in sixth. Computer vision, an essential part of artificial intelligence, uses visual data as input to process photos and videos continuously in order to get better results faster and with higher quality than would be possible if the same job were done manually. Simply put, doctors can now diagnose their patients with diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders more quickly and at an earlier stage. Here are a few examples of real-world applications where computer vision technology is making notable strides. Mammogram images are analysed by visual systems that are intended to spot breast cancer at an early stage. Automated cell counting is another example from the real world that dramatically decreases human error and raises concerns about the accuracy of the results because they might differ greatly depending on the examiner's experience and degree of focus. A third application of computer vision in the real world is the quick and painless early-stage tumour detection enabled by artificial intelligence. Without a doubt, computer vision has the unfathomable potential to significantly enhance how healthcare is delivered. Other than for visual data analysis, clinicians can use this technology to enhance their training and skill development. Currently, Gramener is the top company offering medical facilities and research organisations computer vision solutions [7]. The usage of imperative rather than functional programming languages is one of the key difficulties in creating artificial intelligence software. As artificial intelligence starts to increase exponentially, developers employing imperative programming languages must assume that the machine is stupid and supply detailed instructions that are subject to a high level of maintenance and human error. In software with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, human error detection is challenging. Therefore, the substantial amount of ensuing maintenance may become ridiculously expensive, maintaining the high expenditures of research and development. As a result, software developers have contributed to the unreasonably high cost of medical care. Functional programming languages, on the other hand, demand that the developer use their problem-solving abilities as though the computer were a mathematician. As a result, compared to the number of lines of code needed by the programme to perform the same operation, mathematical functions are orders of magnitude shorter. In software with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, human error detection is challenging. Therefore, the substantial amount of ensuing maintenance may become ridiculously expensive, maintaining the high expenditures o}

  abstract={Physics quantitative literacy (PQL)—applying familiar mathematics in novel ways in the context of physics— is ubiquitous across physics classrooms. The Physics Inventory for Quantitative Literacy, or PIQL, is a recently published reasoning inventory that can be used to assess PQL from calculus-based introductory physics through upper division courses (White Brahmia et al. 2021). There remains a need, however, for assessment of quantitative reasoning at the algebra-based level which includes not only algebra-based college courses but also pre-college physics courses. We present recent work adapting the PIQL to an algebra-based context towards developing the GERQN—the Generalized Equation-based Reasoning inventory for Quantities and Negativity. We report lessons learned from our efforts to adapt items from the calculus-based PIQL to the algebra-based GERQN, and provide examples of how items were revised to be within students proximal zone. We also report on our experience translating the GERQN into Flemish as part of a larger, on-going research project, and what we learned about language accessibility for native and non-native English speakers alike for developing assessment items, curricular materials, and when speaking with students.}

A successful autoformalization system could advance the fields of formal verification, program synthesis, and artificial intelligence. While the long-term goal of autoformalization seemed elusive for a long time, we show large language models provide new prospects towards this goal. We make the surprising observation that LLMs can correctly translate a significant portion ($25.3\%$) of mathematical competition problems perfectly to formal specifications in Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate the usefulness of this process by improving a previously introduced neural theorem prover via training on these autoformalized theorems. Our methodology results in a new state-of-the-art result on the MiniF2F theorem proving benchmark, improving the proof rate from $29.6\%$ to $35.2\%$.}

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like"Let's think step by step"to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the"Let's think step by step"prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

Generation of didactically sound questions is challenging, requiring understanding of the reasoning process involved in the problem. We hypothesize that such questioning strategy can not only enhance the human performance, but also assist the math word problem (MWP) solvers.In this work, we explore the ability of large language models (LMs) in generating sequential questions for guiding math word problem-solving. We propose various guided question generation schemes based on input conditioning and reinforcement learning.On both automatic and human quality evaluations, we find that LMs constrained with desirable question properties generate superior questions and improve the overall performance of a math word problem solver. We conduct a preliminary user study to examine the potential value of such question generation models in the education domain. Results suggest that the difficulty level of problems plays an important role in determining whether questioning improves or hinders human performance. We discuss the future of using such questioning strategies in education.}

  abstract={With the development of computer technology, computers have become a part of people’s lives and the Internet has connected the world’s networks as a whole. Computer technology is changing people’s study, life, and work. People’s traditional education mode, thinking, content, method, and talent training program have a significant impact. The development from traditional to computer technology-based teaching methods has brought new developments and leaps in educational technology. This paper analyzes the research background, significance, and research status of the advanced mathematics auxiliary teaching system, introduces the related technologies and development modes used in the development of the system, and especially discusses the access database technology by ADO and the mathematical expression based on MathML language. Secondly, starting from the actual teaching, we analyze the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system in detail and make detailed planning and design for the system architecture, database selection, functional modules, etc. The design and implementation process of this teaching system are summarized. The teaching strategy inference engine is the key to the personalization and intelligence of the ICAI system. According to the learning models provided by different students, the system designs a corresponding teaching sequence for the learners by controlling the meta-knowledge of the domain knowledge base. The teaching strategy inference engine cuts the domain knowledge tree, selects the knowledge points suitable for the student, and sorts the selected knowledge points reasonably to generate an optimal teaching sequence. According to the students’ learning situation, combined with the teaching rules in the teaching rule library, the students’ grades are dynamically adjusted, so as to select new learning content for students and provide teaching suggestions in time. The student model is the premise of the ICAI system to achieve individualization and intelligence. The system makes a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis of students through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and fuzzy reasoning. On this basis, a cognitive student model is established, which is the teaching strategy that provided the basis for the formulation.}

  abstract={Large-scale pre-training has shown promising results on the vision-and-language navigation (VLN) task. However, most existing pre-training methods employ discrete panoramas to learn visual-textual associations. This requires the model to implicitly correlate incomplete, duplicate observations within the panoramas, which may impair an agent's spatial understanding. Thus, we propose a new map-based pre-training paradigm that is spatial-aware for use in VLN. Concretely, we build a local metric map to explicitly aggregate incomplete observations and remove duplicates, while modeling navigation dependency in a global topological map. This hybrid design can balance the demand of VLN for both short-term reasoning and long-term planning. Then, based on the hybrid map, we devise a pre-training framework to learn a multimodal map representation, which enhances spatial-aware cross-modal reasoning thereby facilitating the language-guided navigation goal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the map-based pre-training route for VLN, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art on four VLN benchmarks.}

  abstract={
 Exchange in ideas between language evolution and biological evolution has a long history, due to a shared theoretical foundation between language and biology as two evolving systems. Both systems evolve in terms of the frequency of a variant in a population for each of a large number of variables, that is how often a particular variant of a language variable is used in a speaker community and how many individuals in a biological population carry a particular variant of a gene. The way these frequencies change has been modelled under a similar mathematical framework. Here, I show how we can use concepts from genome wide association studies that identify the source of natural selection and the genes under selection in a biological population to study how social factors affect the usage of language variables in a speaker community or how some social groups use some language variables differently from other groups. Using the Gurindji Kriol language as a case study, I show how this approach unifies existing mathematical and statistical tools in studying language evolution over a large number of speakers and a large number of language variables, which provides a promising link between micro- and macro-evolution in language. The approach is named BayesVarbrul and is ready to apply to datasets other than the Gurindji Kriol dataset, including existing corpus data.

  abstract={Spatial understanding is a fundamental aspect of computer vision and integral for human-level reasoning about images, making it an important component for grounded language understanding. While recent text-to-image synthesis (T2I) models have shown unprecedented improvements in photorealism, it is unclear whether they have reliable spatial understanding capabilities. We investigate the ability of T2I models to generate correct spatial relationships among objects and present VISOR, an evaluation metric that captures how accurately the spatial relationship described in text is generated in the image. To benchmark existing models, we introduce a dataset, $\mathrm{SR}_{2D}$, that contains sentences describing two or more objects and the spatial relationships between them. We construct an automated evaluation pipeline to recognize objects and their spatial relationships, and employ it in a large-scale evaluation of T2I models. Our experiments reveal a surprising finding that, although state-of-the-art T2I models exhibit high image quality, they are severely limited in their ability to generate multiple objects or the specified spatial relations between them. Our analyses demonstrate several biases and artifacts of T2I models such as the difficulty with generating multiple objects, a bias towards generating the first object mentioned, spatially inconsistent outputs for equivalent relationships, and a correlation between object co-occurrence and spatial understanding capabilities. We conduct a human study that shows the alignment between VISOR and human judgement about spatial understanding. We offer the $\mathrm{SR}_{2D}$ dataset and the VISOR metric to the community in support of T2I reasoning research.}

  abstract={Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit"breakthrough"behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.}

In order to use CTC model as an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, the beam search decoding with an external language model like n-gram LM is necessary to obtain reasonable results. In this paper we analyze the blank label in CTC beam search deeply and propose a very simple method to reduce the amount of calculation resulting in faster beam search decoding speed. With this method, we can get up to 78% faster decoding speed than ordinary beam search decoding with a very small loss of accuracy in LibriSpeech datasets. We prove this method is effective not only practically by experiments but also theoretically by mathematical reasoning. We also observe that this reduction is more obvious if the accuracy of the model is higher.}

  abstract={Large-scale visual-linguistic pre-training aims to capture the generic representations from multimodal features, which are essential for downstream vision-language tasks. Existing methods mostly focus on learning the semantic connections between visual objects and linguistic content, which tend to be recognitionlevel information and may not be sufficient for commonsensical reasoning tasks like VCR. In this paper, we propose a novel commonsensical vision-language pre-training framework to bridge the gap. We first augment the conventional image-caption pre-training datasets with commonsense inferences from a visuallinguistic GPT-2. To pre-train models on image, caption and commonsense inferences together, we propose two new tasks: masked commonsense modeling (MCM) and commonsense type prediction (CTP). To reduce the shortcut effect between captions and commonsense inferences, we further introduce the domain-wise adaptive masking that dynamically adjusts the masking ratio. Experimental results on downstream tasks, VCR and VQA, show the improvement of our pre-training strategy over previous methods. Human evaluation also validates the relevance, informativeness, and diversity of the generated commonsense inferences. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of incorporating commonsense knowledge into the conventional recognition-level visual-linguistic pre-training.}

Common approaches that leverage LLMs for planning are unable to recover when actions fail and resort to retrying failed actions without resolving the underlying cause. We propose a novel approach (CAPE) that generates corrective actions to resolve precondition errors during planning. CAPE improves the quality of generated plans through few-shot reasoning on action preconditions. Our approach enables embodied agents to execute more tasks than baseline methods while maintaining semantic correctness and minimizing re-prompting. In VirtualHome, CAPE improves a human-annotated plan correctness metric from 28.89% to 49.63% over SayCan, whilst achieving competitive executability. Our improvements transfer to a Boston Dynamics Spot robot initialized with a set of skills (specified in language) and associated preconditions, where CAPE improves correctness by 76.49% with higher executability compared to SayCan. Our approach enables embodied agents to follow natural language commands and robustly recover from failures.}

Since the question posed may not be about the scene in the image, but about the state of the scene before or after the actions are applied, the solver envision or imagine the state changes due to these actions. Solving these word problems requires a combination of language, visual and mathematical reasoning. We apply state-of-the-art neural and neuro-symbolic models for visual question answering on CLEVR-Math and empirically evaluate their performances.

  abstract={Implicit event argument extraction (EAE) aims to identify arguments that could scatter over the document. Most previous work focuses on learning the direct relations between arguments and the given trigger, while the implicit relations with long-range dependency are not well studied. Moreover, recent neural network based approaches rely on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is unavailable due to the high labelling cost. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum learning based Prompt tuning (CUP) approach, which resolves implicit EAE by four learning stages. The stages are defined according to the relations with the trigger node in a semantic graph, which well captures the long-range dependency between arguments and the trigger. In addition, we integrate a prompt-based encoder-decoder model to elicit related knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs) in each stage, where the prompt templates are adapted with the learning progress to enhance the reasoning for arguments. Experimental results on two well-known benchmark datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we outperform the state-of-the-art models in both fully-supervised and low-data scenarios.}

We extract a set of such concepts from annotated explanations and measure how much can models benefit from presenting these concepts in few-shot demonstrations.We find that smaller models are more sensitive to the presented concepts. While some of the models are able to benefit from concept-presenting demonstrations for each assessed concept, we find that none of the assessed in-context learners can benefit from all presented reasoning concepts consistently, leaving the in-context concept learning an open challenge.}

  abstract={Augmenting pretrained language models with retrievers to select the supporting documents has shown promise in effectively solving common NLP problems, including language modeling and question answering, in an interpretable way. In this paper, we first study the strengths and weaknesses of different retriever-augmented language models (REALM, $k$NN-LM, FiD coupled with DPR, and ATLAS and Flan-T5 coupled with Contriever) in reasoning over the retrieved statements in different tasks. We show how the retrieve-then-read models' limitations in reasoning are rooted both in the retriever module as well as the language model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the similarity metric used by the retrievers is generally insufficient for reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that the language models in retriever-augmented models do not take the complicated relations between the statements into account, which leads to poor reasoning performance even when using the larger models. Moreover, we analyze the reasoning performance of large language models using multihop retrieval but we only observe minor improvements. Overall, this shows great room for further research in this area.}

We find that, while transformer-based language models perform surprisingly well in these scenarios, a deeper analysis reveals that they appear to overfit to superficial patterns in the data rather than acquiring the logical principles governing the reasoning in these fragments.}

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.}

  abstract={Visual question answering is an important task in both natural language and vision understanding. However, in most of the public visual question answering datasets such as VQA, CLEVR, the questions are human generated that specific to the given image, such as 'What color are her eyes?'. The human generated crowdsourcing questions are relatively simple and sometimes have the bias toward certain entities or attributes [1, 55]. In this paper, we introduce a new question answering dataset based on image-ChiQA. It contains the real-world queries issued by internet users, combined with several related open-domain images. The system should determine whether the image could answer the question or not. Different from previous VQA datasets, the questions are real-world image-independent queries that are more various and unbiased. Compared with previous image-retrieval or image-caption datasets, the ChiQA not only measures the relatedness but also measures the answerability, which demands more fine-grained vision and language reasoning. ChiQA contains more than 40K questions and more than 200K question-images pairs. A three-level 2/1/0 label is assigned to each pair indicating perfect answer, partially answer and irrelevant. Data analysis shows ChiQA requires a deep understanding of both language and vision, including grounding, comparisons, and reading. We evaluate several state-of-the-art visual-language models such as ALBEF, demonstrating that there is still a large room for improvements on ChiQA.}

  abstract={Surveys have long been used in physics education research to understand student reasoning and inform course improvements. However, to make analysis of large sets of responses practical, most surveys use a closed-response format with a small set of potential responses. Open-ended formats, such as written free response, can provide deeper insights into student thinking, but take much longer to analyze, especially with a large number of responses. Here, we explore natural language processing as a computational solution to this problem. We create a machine learning model that can take student responses from the Physics Measurement Questionnaire as input, and output a categorization of student reasoning based on different reasoning paradigms. Our model yields classifications with the same level of agreement as that between two humans categorizing the data, but can be done by a computer, and thus can be scaled for large datasets. In this work, we describe the algorithms and methodologies used to create, train, and test our natural language processing system. We also present the results of the analysis and discuss the utility of these approaches for analyzing open-response data in education research. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.18.010141}

Researchers have recognized that, while large language models (LLMs) have tremendous utility, they can be augmented with symbolic means to be even better and to make up for any flaws that the neural networks might have. However, symbolic methods are extremely costly in terms of the amount of time and expertise needed to create them. In this work, we capitalize on state-of-the-art Code-LLMs, such as Codex, to bootstrap the use of symbolic methods for tracking the state of stories and aiding in story understanding. We show that our CoRRPUS system and abstracted prompting procedures can beat current state-of-the-art structured LLM techniques on pre-existing story understanding tasks (bAbI Task 2 and Re^3) with minimal hand engineering. We hope that this work can help highlight the importance of symbolic representations and specialized prompting for LLMs as these models require some guidance for performing reasoning tasks properly.}

To be specific, in this multimodal task/dataset, models are given an image and an initial question-response pair about the image. Next, a counterfactual imagined scene change (in textual form) is applied, and the model has to predict the new response to the initial question based on this scene change. We collect 3.5K high-quality and challenging data instances, with each instance consisting of an image, a commonsense question with a response, a description of a counterfactual change, a new response to the question, and three distractor responses. Our dataset contains various complex scene change types (such as object addition/removal/state change, event description, environment change, etc.) that require models to imagine many different scenarios and reason about the changed scenes. We present a baseline model based on a vision-language Transformer (i.e., LXMERT) and ablation studies. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate a large human-model performance gap, suggesting room for promising future work on this challenging, counterfactual multimodal task.}

When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (‘faster’) depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense). This paper presents Code as Policies: a robot-centric formulation of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based policies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms. Central to our approach is prompting hierarchical code-gen (recursively defining undefined functions), which can write more complex code and also improves state-of-the-art to solve 39.8% of problems on the HumanEval [1] benchmark.

  abstract={Developers often have questions about semantic aspects of code they are working on, e.g., “Is there a class whose parent classes declare a conflicting attribute?”. Answering them requires understanding code semantics such as attributes and inheritance relation of classes. An answer to such a question should identify code spans constituting the answer (e.g., the declaration of the subclass) as well as supporting facts (e.g., the definitions of the conflicting attributes). The existing work on question-answering over code has considered yes/no questions or method-level context. We contribute a labeled dataset, called CodeQueries, of semantic queries over Python code. Compared to the existing datasets, in CodeQueries, the queries are about code semantics, the context is file level and the answers are code spans. We curate the dataset based on queries supported by a widely-used static analysis tool, CodeQL, and include both positive and negative examples, and queries requiring single-hop and multi-hop reasoning. To assess the value of our dataset, we evaluate baseline neural approaches. We study a large language model (GPT3.5-Turbo) in zero-shot and few-shot settings on a subset of CodeQueries. We also evaluate a BERT style model (CuBERT) with fine-tuning. We find that these models achieve limited success on CodeQueries. CodeQueries is thus a challenging dataset to test the ability of neural models, to understand code semantics, in the extractive question-answering setting.}

  abstract={We study video-grounded dialogue generation, where a response is generated based on the dialogue context and the associated video. The primary challenges of this task lie in (1) the difficulty of integrating video data into pre-trained language models (PLMs) which presents obstacles to exploiting the power of large-scale pre-training; and (2) the necessity of taking into account the complementarity of various modalities throughout the reasoning process. Although having made remarkable progress in video-grounded dialogue generation, existing methods still fall short when it comes to integrating with PLMs in a way that allows information from different modalities to complement each other. To alleviate these issues, we first propose extracting pertinent information from videos and turning it into reasoning paths that are acceptable to PLMs. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to collaboratively perform reasoning on different modalities (i.e., video and dialogue context). Empirical experiment results on two public datasets indicate that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art models by large margins on both automatic and human evaluations.}

  abstract={Interviewing potential candidates is both time consuming and resource intensive. This is particularly prominent in organizations which go for large scale recruitment processes. In the current study, a client based application has been proposed for interviewing candidates for data science profiles where interviewee’s answers are scored using machine learning. Different approaches were tried with pretrained models but as the application was very much domain specific, those models did not provide good results. Hence a custom embedding layer was built on open source data science textbooks. These embeddings were used with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to capture a local approach (subject specific) in the interview answers. However, this neglected the nuances of the English language involved in critical reasoning. Hence Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) was employed to capture the global approach (interaction between words in the English language) in the interview answers. The similarity scores from these two approaches were ensembled into a machine learning model which allotted the final score to the interviewee’s answer. The proposed method outperformed the pretrained models with significant margin when tested with the validation data.}

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in learning from explanations in prompts, but there has been limited understanding of exactly how these explanations function or why they are effective. This work aims to better understand the mechanisms by which explanations are used for in-context learning. We first study the impact of two different factors on the performance of prompts with explanations: the computation trace (the way the solution is decomposed) and the natural language used to express the prompt. By perturbing explanations on three controlled tasks, we show that both factors contribute to the effectiveness of explanations. We further study how to form maximally effective sets of explanations for solving a given test query. We find that LLMs can benefit from the complementarity of the explanation set: diverse reasoning skills shown by different exemplars can lead to better performance. Therefore, we propose a maximal marginal relevance-based exemplar selection approach for constructing exemplar sets that are both relevant as well as complementary, which successfully improves the in-context learning performance across three real-world tasks on multiple LLMs.}

  abstract={We study the task of prompting large-scale language models to perform multi-step reasoning. Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, large language models can generate new reasoning chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexity-based prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step reasoning. We show that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on multi-step reasoning tasks over strong baselines. We further extend our complexity-based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains). When used to prompt GPT-3 and Codex, our approach substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three math benchmarks (GSM8K, MultiArith, and MathQA) and two BigBenchHard tasks (Date Understanding and Penguins), with an average +5.3 and up to +18 accuracy improvements. Compared with existing example selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient. Further results demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift.}

  abstract={Large pre-trained models exhibit distinct and complementary capabilities dependent on the data they are trained on. Language models such as GPT-3 are capable of textual reasoning but cannot understand visual information, while vision models such as DALL-E can generate photorealistic photos but fail to understand complex language descriptions. In this work, we propose a unified framework for composing ensembles of different pre-trained models -- combining the strengths of each individual model to solve various multimodal problems in a zero-shot manner. We use pre-trained models as"generators"or"scorers"and compose them via closed-loop iterative consensus optimization. The generator constructs proposals and the scorers iteratively provide feedback to refine the generated result. Such closed-loop communication enables models to correct errors caused by other models, significantly boosting performance on downstream tasks, e.g. improving accuracy on grade school math problems by 7.5%, without requiring any model finetuning. We demonstrate that consensus achieved by an ensemble of scorers outperforms the feedback of a single scorer, by leveraging the strengths of each expert model. Results show that the proposed method can be used as a general purpose framework for a wide range of zero-shot multimodal tasks, such as image generation, video question answering, mathematical reasoning, and robotic manipulation.

This work seeks to utilise and build on the growing body of work that uses findings from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to extract knowledge from text and build knowledge graphs. The focus of this research project is on how we can use transformer-based approaches to extract and contextualise event information, matching it to existing ontologies, to build comprehensive knowledge graph-based event representations. Specifically, sub-event extraction is used as a way of creating sub-event-aware event representations. These event representations are then further enriched through fine-grained location extraction and contextualised through the alignment of historically relevant quotes.}

  abstract={From the stages of the computational experiment, the stage of non-dimensionalization of the initial equation (system of equations) of the problem is considered - the replacement of its variables by the product of the corresponding dimensionless quantities by their units of measurement with subsequent transformations. Such a transition from a physical model to a mathematical (dimensionless) one makes it possible to obtain software implementations for research. A critical evaluation of its complexity is carried out and possible errors in the results are evaluated. At the same time, new versions of software are formed. Object-oriented programming tools and version control systems (for example, git) allow you to create versions of software tools adapted to different conditions of their use and for different types of users. Parallelization of work on versions is carried out. At the same time, for further software implementation, the set-theoretic language of formulas with partially recursive functions is effective. To implement versions with large amounts of calculations and data, high-performance computing systems based on software and hardware acceleration, parallel information processing and cloud architectures are used. As a rule, a difference model of the problem and iterative methods for solving it are constructed for a program version. Computational stability conditions are usually stipulated in modern instructions for standard program libraries. For new algorithms, it is necessary to analyze the stability of difference schemes based on the refinement of their spectral properties and the use of functional analysis methods. For storage and subsequent application of the results of computational experiments, it is advisable to use modern databases. As a kind of computational experiment, testing of alpha and beta versions of programs and their releases is also considered.}

  abstract={Recently, large-scale pre-trained Vision-and-Language (VL) foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many zero-shot downstream tasks, achieving competitive results for recognizing objects defined by as little as short text prompts. However, it has also been shown that VL models are still brittle in Structured VL Concept (SVLC) reasoning, such as the ability to recognize object attributes, states, and inter-object relations. This leads to reasoning mistakes, which need to be corrected as they occur by teaching VL models the missing SVLC skills; often this must be done using private data where the issue was found, which naturally leads to a data-free continual (no task-id) VL learning setting. In this work, we introduce the first Continual Data-Free Structured VL Concepts Learning (ConStruct-VL) benchmark11Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jamessealesmith/ConStruct-VL and show it is challenging for many existing data-free CL strategies. We, therefore, propose a data-free method comprised of a new approach of Adversarial Pseudo-Replay (APR) which generates adversarial reminders of past tasks from past task models. To use this method efficiently, we also propose a continual parameter-efficient Layered-LoRA (LaLo) neural architecture allowing no-memory-cost access to all past models at train time. We show this approach outperforms all data-free methods by as much as ~ 7% while even matching some levels of experience-replay (prohibitive for applications where data-privacy must be preserved).}

  abstract={Fractions are a challenging mathematics topic for many elementary and middle school students, and even for adults. However, a growing body of developmental research suggests that young children can reason about visually presented proportions, well before fraction instruction, providing insight into how fractions might be introduced to improve learning. We designed a card game to teach first and second grade children (N = 195, including a racially and economically diverse sample from the United States) about fractions in one of three ways. In the Actively Divided condition we iteratively divided an area model into equal-sized units, in the Predivided condition we used an area model with the end-state of the Actively Divided condition, and in the Nondivided condition we used a continuous representation of the fraction magnitude that was not divided into unit-sized parts. Children in the actively divided condition demonstrated larger improvements matching symbolic fractions and visual fractions (i.e., pie charts) than children in the other two conditions. Posthoc analyses of children's gameplay revealed that the actively divided condition may have provided a more optimal level of difficulty for young children than the predivided condition, which was particularly difficult, and the nondivided condition, which was trivially easy. These differences in gameplay performance provide insights into possible mechanisms for our results. We discuss open research questions highlighted by this work and implications of these findings for both the development of proportional reasoning and fraction learning.

The study showed that the pulse response function is the output signal of the system during signal processing, when the input signal is a short pulse. In a more general form, the impulse response function describes the response or output of the system as a function of time. Also, the impulse response function is considered a property of linear displacement systems. During the study of the estimation of the impulse response function on orthonormal and trigonometric bases, two conditions A, B and remarks to them were formed, which are used in the future to find different coefficients. The study of square-Gaussian random variables and processes has shown the benefits of using them in relation to the impulse response function. A theorem was also presented, which estimated the probability of a large deviation of the square-Gaussian process in the norm of a continuous function. To study the rate of convergence of the unknown impulse response function in the space of continuous functions and in the space L2, a lemma was formed, as well as a theorem that directly showed the rate of convergence of the impulse response function in the space of continuous functions. Zero and alternative hypotheses were formed. The null hypothesis claimed that the impulse response function existed, and the alternative hypothesis suggested the opposite. To test the hypothesis about the form of the impulse response function, a theorem was used by which a criterion was formed. Visual Studio Community 2022 integrated development environment (C ++ programming language) and Wolfram Mathematica computer algebra system for analytical transformations and numerical calculations were used to build the simulation model, which allowed to make mathematical calculations quite accurately.}

  abstract={Contemporary deep neural networks offer state-of-the-art results when applied to visual reasoning, e.g., in the context of 3D point cloud data. Point clouds are important datatype for precise modeling of three-dimensional environments, but effective processing of this type of data proves to be challenging. In the world of large, heavily-parameterized network architectures and continuously-streamed data, there is an increasing need for machine learning models that can be trained on additional data. Unfortunately, currently available models cannot fully leverage training on additional data without losing their past knowledge. Combating this phenomenon, called catastrophic forgetting, is one of the main objectives of continual learning. Continual learning for deep neural networks has been an active field of research, primarily in 2D computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and robotics. However, in 3D computer vision, there are hardly any continual learning solutions specifically designed to take advantage of point cloud structure. This work proposes a novel neural network architecture capable of continual learning on 3D point cloud data. We utilize point cloud structure properties for preserving a heavily compressed set of past data. By using rehearsal and reconstruction as regularization methods of the learning process, our approach achieves a significant decrease of catastrophic forgetting compared to the existing solutions on several most popular point cloud datasets considering two continual learning settings: when a task is known beforehand, and in the challenging scenario of when task information is unknown to the model.}

Nevertheless, existing approaches mainly focus on pre-training with simple image-text pairs, while neglecting the semantic connections between concepts from different modalities. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based pre-training framework, dubbed Knowledge-CLIP, which injects semantic information into the widely used CLIP model. Through introducing knowledge-based objectives in the pre-training process and utilizing different types of knowledge graphs as training data, our model can semantically align the representations in vision and language with higher quality, and enhance the reasoning ability across scenarios and modalities. Extensive experiments on various vision-language downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Knowledge-CLIP compared with the original CLIP and competitive baselines.}

Although the physical picture connected to Feynman diagrams is no longer based on energy non-conserving transitions but on off-shell particles, emission and absorption subprocesses still remain their fundamental constituents. This article will access the introduction and the initial reception of this picture of subsequent transitions (PST) by conceiving of concepts, models, and their representations as tools for the practitioners. I will argue for a multi-factorial explanation of Dirac’s initial, verbally explicit introduction: the mathematical representation he had developed was highly suggestive and already partly conceptualized; Dirac was philosophical flexible enough to talk about transitions when no actual transitions, according to the general interpretation of quantum mechanics of the time, occurred; and, importantly, Dirac eventually used the verbal exposition in the same paper in which he introduced it. The direct impact of PST on the conception of quantum electrodynamical processes will be exemplified by its reflection in diagrammatical representations. The study of the diverging ontological commitments towards PST immediately after its introduction opens up the prehistory of a philosophical debate that stretches out into the present: the dispute about the representational and ontological status of the physical picture connected to the evaluation of the perturbative series of QED and QFT.}

  abstract={Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on understanding of the real world. In this paper we tease these factors apart by leveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of tests drawn from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from a variety of popular pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.}

  abstract={A large portion of mathematics education centers heavily around imitative reasoning and rote learning, raising concerns about students’ lack of deeper and conceptual understanding of mathematics. To address these concerns, there has been a growing focus on students learning and teachers teaching methods that aim to enhance conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. One suggestion is allowing students to construct their own solution methods using creative mathematical reasoning (CMR), a method that in previous studies has been contrasted against algorithmic reasoning (AR) with positive effects on test tasks. Although previous studies have evaluated the effects of CMR, they have ignored if and to what extent intrinsic cognitive motivation play a role. This study investigated the effects of intrinsic cognitive motivation to engage in cognitive strenuous mathematical tasks, operationalized through Need for Cognition (NFC), and working memory capacity (WMC). Two independent groups, consisting of upper secondary students (N = 137, mean age 17.13, SD = 0.62, 63 boys and 74 girls), practiced non-routine mathematical problem solving with CMR and AR tasks and were tested 1 week later. An initial t-test confirmed that the CMR group outperformed the AR group. Structural equation modeling revealed that NFC was a significant predictor of math performance for the CMR group but not for the AR group. The results also showed that WMC was a strong predictor of math performance independent of group. These results are discussed in terms of allowing for time and opportunities for struggle with constructing own solution methods using CMR, thereby enhancing students conceptual understanding.}

Potentially related to the great information research of artificial reasoning (AI), the various embodiments of utilitarian phonetics have routinely experienced problems in applications. As a result, it created critical difficulties for the far-reaching improvement of useful etymology. In this unique situation, ideas related to the improvement of useful phonetics and artificial reasoning are explained. Starting from this premise, the useful etymologies of innovative union and internal incorporation are analyzed with respect to the scenario of large-scale information AI research. In addition, in order to stimulate the useful advancement of phonetics inside and outside, this study makes some proposals, among which are the rationalization of a dispersed group climate, the promotion of a practical phase of information about the language, the assumption of models, modalities of equality of information and the transmission of an equitable preparation of the brain network. These ideas constitute an initial phase of hypothetical etymological analyzes and capacity for improvement. In addition, some ideas were made to advance the internal and external improvement of the utilitarian etymology, such as structuring a useful linguistic information phase, updating an adequate group climate, preparing the circulating brain network, assuming equal information patterns and modalities to provide a reference to skills development and hypothetical phonetic exploration.}

  abstract={The digital transformation in the finance and enterprise sector has been driven by the advances made in big data and artificial intelligence technologies. For instance, data integration enables businesses to make better decisions by consolidating and mining heterogeneous data repositories. In particular, knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to facilitate the integration of disparate data sources and can be utilized to answer complex queries. This work proposes a new dataset for question-answering on knowledge graphs (KGQA) to reflect the challenges we identified in real-world applications which are not covered by existing benchmarks, namely, multi-hop constraints, numeric and literal embeddings, ranking, reification, and hyper-relations. To build the dataset, we create a new Knowledge Graph from the Crunchbase database using a lightweight schema to support high-quality entity embeddings in large graphs. Next, we create a Question Answering dataset based on natural language question generation using predefined multiple-hop templates and paraphrasing. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art KGQA models and compare their performance on CrunchQA. The results show that the existing models do not perform well, for example, on multi-hop constrained queries. Hence, CrunchQA can be used as a challenging benchmark dataset for future KGQA reasoning models. The dataset and scripts are available on the project repository. 1}

  abstract={In the age of large transformer language models, linguistic evaluation play an important role in diagnosing models’ abilities and limitations on natural language understanding. However, current evaluation methods show some significant shortcomings. In particular, they do not provide insight into how well a language model captures distinct linguistic skills essential for language understanding and reasoning. Thus they fail to effectively map out the aspects of language understanding that remain challenging to existing models, which makes it hard to discover potential limitations in models and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum as a new format of NLI benchmark for evaluation of broad-coverage linguistic phenomena. Curriculum contains a collection of datasets that covers 36 types of major linguistic phenomena and an evaluation procedure for diagnosing how well a language model captures reasoning skills for distinct types of linguistic phenomena. We show that this linguistic-phenomena-driven benchmark can serve as an effective tool for diagnosing model behavior and verifying model learning quality. In addition, our experiments provide insight into the limitation of existing benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models that may encourage future research on re-designing datasets, model architectures, and learning objectives.}

  abstract={Visual language such as charts and plots is ubiquitous in the human world. Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than>28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.}

  abstract={Recent studies have shown that strong Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models are prone to relying on annotation biases of the datasets as a shortcut, which goes against the underlying mechanisms of the task of interest. To reduce such biases, several recent works introduce debiasing methods to regularize the training process of targeted NLU models. In this paper, we provide a new perspective with causal inference to find out the bias. On one hand, we show that there is an unobserved confounder for the natural language utterances and their respective classes, leading to spurious correlations from training data. To remove such confounder, the backdoor adjustment with causal intervention is utilized to find the true causal effect, which makes the training process fundamentally different from the traditional likelihood estimation. On the other hand, in inference process, we formulate the bias as the direct causal effect and remove it by pursuing the indirect causal effect with counterfactual reasoning. We conduct experiments on large-scale natural language inference and fact verification benchmarks, evaluating on bias sensitive datasets that are specifically designed to assess the robustness of models against known biases in the training data. Experimental results show that our proposed debiasing framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art debiasing methods while maintaining the original in-distribution performance.}

  abstract={Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

  abstract={Causal reasoning provides a language to ask important interventional and counterfactual questions beyond purely statistical association. In medical imaging, for example, we may want to study the causal effect of genetic, environmental, or lifestyle factors on the normal and pathological variation of anatomical phenotypes. However, while anatomical shape models of 3D surface meshes, extracted from automated image segmentation, can be reliably constructed, there is a lack of computational tooling to enable causal reasoning about morphological variations. To tackle this problem, we propose deep structural causal shape models (CSMs), which utilise high-quality mesh generation techniques, from geometric deep learning, within the expressive framework of deep structural causal models. CSMs enable subject-specific prognoses through counterfactual mesh generation ("How would this patient's brain structure change if they were ten years older?"), which is in contrast to most current works on purely population-level statistical shape modelling. We demonstrate the capabilities of CSMs at all levels of Pearl's causal hierarchy through a number of qualitative and quantitative experiments leveraging a large dataset of 3D brain structures.}

  abstract={To provide a complete portrayal of the multiple factors negatively impacting insects in agricultural landscapes it is necessary to assess the concurrent incidence, magnitude, and interactions among multiple stressors over substantial biogeographical scales. Trans-national ecological field investigations with wide-ranging stakeholders typically encounter numerous challenges during the design planning stages, not least that the scientific soundness of a spatially replicated study design must account for the substantial geographic and climatic variation among distant sites. ‘PoshBee’ (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of Stressors on the Health of Bees) is a multi-partner transdisciplinary agroecological project established to investigate the suite of stressors typically encountered by pollinating insects in European agricultural landscapes. To do this, PoshBee established a network of 128 study sites across eight European countries and collected over 50 measurements and samples relating to the nutritional, toxicological, pathogenic, and landscape components of the bees’ environment. This paper describes the development process, rationale, and end-result of each aspect of the of the PoshBee field investigation. We describe the main issues and challenges encountered during the design stages and highlight a number of actions or processes that may benefit other multi-partner research consortia planning similar large-scale studies. It was soon identified that in a multi-component study design process, the development of interaction and communication networks involving all collaborators and stakeholders requires considerable time and resources. It was also necessary at each planning stage to be mindful of the needs and objectives of all stakeholders and partners, and further challenges inevitably arose when practical limitations, such as time restrictions and labour constraints, were superimposed upon prototype study designs. To promote clarity for all stakeholders, for each sub-component of the study, there should be a clear record of the rationale and reasoning that outlines how the final design transpired, what compromises were made, and how the requirements of different stakeholders were accomplished. Ultimately, multi-national agroecological field studies such as PoshBee benefit greatly from the involvement of diverse stakeholders and partners, ranging from field ecologists, project managers, policy legislators, mathematical modelers, and farmer organisations. While the execution of the study highlighted the advantages and benefits of large-scale transdisciplinary projects, the long planning period emphasized the need to formally describe a design framework that could facilitate the design process of future multi-partner collaborations.}

  abstract={Fuzzy control theory generates fuzzy rules based on expert experience and experimental data, so fuzzy control method can control complex and large-scale systems without precise mathematical models. But fuzzy control method still has problems: complex structure and rule explosion problem. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a fuzzy control method based on granular computing. Firstly, design the fuzzy controller, the fuzzy rules are generated by the fuzzy space division method. Then, using the information granulation method, each fuzzy rule is granulated into an information granule. Taking points in the information granules to fit the realization function of the granular function, using that function control the object instead of the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy reasoning process is omitted, and the number of rules has nothing to do with the accuracy, it is only related to the number of granules. Therefore, the structure of the control system can be simplified under the condition of ensuring the accuracy of the system, and the problem of rule explosion can be avoided at the same time. The simulation experiment using the second-order inverted pendulum as the control object proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the fuzzy control method based on granular computing.}

The goal was to improve a mathematical model of V. I. Polikovskii method of subsonic air intake shaping for high-bypass ratio turbofan. The tasks are to consider the presence of cant of inlet cross-section, required to perform effective operation at airplane cruising angle-of-attacks; to increase the radius of curvature of the air intake lip to provide air flow near it without flow separation, which was definitely determined and could not be increased in the existing method; to improve constant length velocity gradient law (used in this method) so that too large duct expansion angles near the air intake outlet cross-section can be avoided; to consider the engine inlet spinner presence. The methods used are analytical and digital mathematical methods, implemented in MathCAD and Microsoft Visual Studio systems. The following results were obtained: based on the proposed method, new calculation module for the Power Unit software version 11.8 has been developed (С-language Win32 UNICODE application) with a friendly user interface. Conclusions. The scientific novelty of the results obtained is as follows: 1) mathematical model (algorithm and its program implementation) for circular turbofan air intake shaping has been improved considering cant of the inlet cross-section, air intake lip rounding with two radiuses, presence of engine inlet spinner, and zero expansion angles in the diffuser outlet cross-section; 2) adequacy of calculation results using the improved mathematical model is shown using comparison with shapes of circular turbofan air intakes, developed by the leading aviation companies.}

  abstract={Students' skills in solving numeracy questions in the AKM are still varied, especially for SD Negeri 3 Mendo Barat students. The implementation of AKM, especially numeracy skills, impacts the learning given to students. Students are not only required to understand mathematical concepts but must demonstrate other mathematical abilities such as reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Therefore, teaching materials are needed that can support the AKM-based learning process. At SD Negeri 3 Mendo Barat, there are still very few teaching materials owned by students, especially those based on AKM. This study aims to develop a companion mathematics module for preparing AKM for fifth-grade elementary school students that is valid, practical, and potentially affects learning outcomes. Development research using a 4-D model is used as a research technique. The research subjects were 22 students of class V SD Negeri 3 Mendo Barat, as many as 22 people. The results showed that the mathematics module was valid and practical—valid seen from the experts' assessment of the module. Experts consist of material, media, and language experts. Practicality is obtained from the results of student questionnaire analysis in a limited field test which shows a practicality percentage of 91.32 per cent. Based on the operational field test results, the average final score of students is 87.05, which indicates that student learning outcomes are in the very good category. The module can potentially affect student learning outcomes in the good category.}

  abstract={Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing -- but at a high cost. In response, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Switch Transformers have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models. But advancing the state-of-the-art across a broad set of natural language tasks has been hindered by training instabilities and uncertain quality during fine-tuning. Our work focuses on these issues and acts as a design guide. We conclude by scaling a sparse model to 269B parameters, with a computational cost comparable to a 32B dense encoder-decoder Transformer (Stable and Transferable Mixture-of-Experts or ST-MoE-32B). For the first time, a sparse model achieves state-of-the-art performance in transfer learning, across a diverse set of tasks including reasoning (SuperGLUE, ARC Easy, ARC Challenge), summarization (XSum, CNN-DM), closed book question answering (WebQA, Natural Questions), and adversarially constructed tasks (Winogrande, ANLI R3).}

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have exploded in popularity in the past few years and have achieved undeniably impressive results on benchmarks as varied as question answering and text summarization. We provide a simple new prompting strategy that leads to yet another supposedly"super-human"result, this time outperforming humans at common sense ethical reasoning (as measured by accuracy on a subset of the ETHICS dataset). Unfortunately, we find that relying on average performance to judge capabilities can be highly misleading. LLM errors differ systematically from human errors in ways that make it easy to craft adversarial examples, or even perturb existing examples to flip the output label. We also observe signs of inverse scaling with model size on some examples, and show that prompting models to"explain their reasoning"often leads to alarming justifications of unethical actions. Our results highlight how human-like performance does not necessarily imply human-like understanding or reasoning.}

  abstract={In recent years, some changes have emerged in the general aims of education programs, and in this context, educational authorities have adopted new approaches aiming at nurturing skills. Especially in moral education, which is an indispensable part of citizenship education, the concept of moral literacy is one of the important isssue of educational discussions. In the literature, there are many studies asserting that schools should educate children for moral literacy as well as primitive language literacy, science and mathematics literacy, intercultural literacy. On the other hand, it should be noted that there are not enough studies dealing with the application of the subject in the field. In addition, it is seen that countries have not yet taken sufficient steps for a change in their educational systems and have not demonstrated a strong will. 
Moral literacy refers to a skill that includes thinking about one's own moral values, determining the possible consequences of various alternatives and their effects, making logical decisions about which option is compatible with one's values, acting in line with one's values, and taking responsibility for one's own actions. Moral literacy, conceptualized by Nancy Tuana, consists of three basic elements, namely moral moral sensitivity, moral reasoning skills, and moral imagination, and three sub-skills under them. These skills generally include the intellectual skills that lead the moral decision-making process. 
This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable attitude scale based on Tuana's theory. Within the scope of the research designed in the general survey model, the relevant literature was scanned and the studies on moral literacy were examined. With the clarification of the theoretical structure, the scale development process was started. The following stages were followed in the development of the moral literacy scale: i. Creating the item pool, ii. Content validaty, iii. Reviewing and finalizing the draft form, iv. Application of the scale, v. Item analysis, analysis of construct validity and reliability analysis, vi. Examining the correlation between subscales and the total score, vii. Putting into the final form of the scale and reporting. 
In the first stage, the draft form consisting of 27 items was sent to five field experts and a language expert, 1 item was removed from the scale as they were not compatible with the scope in line with the suggestions of the field experts, and 1 more item was added. The draft form, which was finalized with changes, was applied to 653 university students studying at Eskişehir Osmangazi University and Anadolu University in the fall semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. 88 data, which were not marked carefully and were not found reliable during the data entry to excel, were excluded from the analysis. In the item analysis of the scale, 3 items were excluded from the draft scale and the construct validity was passed. 
In the exploratory factor analysis, 7 more items with values less than .40 and overlapping were excluded from the analysis. As a result of the factor analysis performed after this process, a structure consisting of 5 factors and 20 items was obtained. As a result of the reliability analysis, it was seen that the whole scale had high reliability, while the sub-dimensions had medium and low reliability levels. It was also determined that the structure obtained by exploratory factor analysis was confirmed as a result of testing with confirmatory factor analysis. According to the path analysis, it can be said that the existing structure fits well. When the relationship between the sub-dimensions of the scale is examined, it can be stated that there is a significant positive relationship between the sub-dimensions and a total score can be obtained for the attitudes towards the moral literacy skill of the scale. As a result, it can be said that the scale obtained as a result of these processes can measure the attitudes of university students towards moral literacy skills in a reliable and valid way.}

  abstract={Taking to the consideration the current state of converter production and measuring equipment at Ukrainian enterprises, it follows that the smelting process is based on a complex dynamic non-deterministic system. The process is complicated by the large number of param-eters, the inability to accurately identify the state of the system at any time, as well as the dif-ficulty of forecasting system requirements. Preliminary analysis has shown that in the conditions of this production converter manufacturing efficiency increase can be reached at the expense of: - reducing the cost of raw materials, such as iron-containing additives, deoxidizers, non-metallic elements in steel; - reduction of melting time, especially blowing time; - reducing defects and improving product quality. It is proposed the architecture of integrated control DSS in converter steel production based on the principle of minimal interference in the production process. The primary aim of such a system is to predict the behavior of the production process, providing the recommen-dations for its impact in order to optimize the external criterion of efficiency. The source and amount of data required for the database formation and DSS knowledge base are substantiated. The mechanism of self-learning in the course of technological tasks is described. The structural scheme of self-learning DSS, self-learning algorithm, which is mainly featured with modularity, is offered in the paper. The approach allows testing of any number of existing algorithms for learning, forecasting and optimization in order to further select the most effective ones, modifies the system in the future and allows the parallel use of a number of com-peting algorithms. The operator has the opportunity to choose as a control solution one of the proposed systems, or the formation of its own, better by a certain external criterion of result quality. Based on the suggested software structure, a number of tasks are formulated that need to be performed to build a decision support system. It is also considered to apply the mathematical apparatus of fuzzy sets to describe certain pa-rameters of the technological process and quality criteria, fuzzy neural network for modeling reasoning processes and the choice of algorithm for its training.}

In this work, we were concerned about this generalisation issue and thus analysed a broad set of models systematically and robustly over long stories. Related experiments were conducted based on the CLUTRR, which is a diagnostic benchmark suite that can analyse generalisation of natural language understanding (NLU) systems by training over small story graphs and testing on larger ones. In order to handle the multi-relational story graph, we consider two classes of neural models:"E-GNN", the graph-based models that can process graph-structured data and consider the edge attributes simultaneously; and"L-Graph", the sequence-based models which can process linearized version of the graphs. We performed an extensive empirical evaluation, and we found that the modified recurrent neural network yield surprisingly accurate results across every systematic generalisation tasks which outperform the modified graph neural network, while the latter produced more robust models.}

  abstract={Step-by-step reasoning approaches like chain of thought (CoT) have proved to be very effective in inducing reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, the success of the CoT approach is fundamentally tied to the model size, and billion parameter-scale models are often needed to get CoT to work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that leverages the step-by-step CoT reasoning capabilities of larger models and distills these abilities into smaller models. In this work, we propose an alternative reasoning scheme, Socratic CoT, that learns a decomposition of the original problem into a sequence of subproblems and uses it to guide the intermediate reasoning steps. We use Socratic CoT to train a combination of two small distilled models: a problem decomposer and a subproblem solver. In practice, given a new problem, the two distilled models work in sync to decompose and solve complex problems. On multiple reasoning datasets (GSM8K, StrategyQA, and SVAMP), our proposed distillation strategies boosts the performance of smaller models over 70% compared to the baselines. Finally, we investigate when Socratic CoT is an effective alternative to CoT, demonstrating cases where a much smaller model (GPT-2 large) can outperform a 10X larger model (GPT-3 6B).

  abstract={I the past year, ACS Omega has seen a dramatic increase in the number of articles published with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks theme. In 2021, 105 articles were published vs 45 articles published in the previous year, an increase of 133%. This exceptional growth for a fully open access broad scope journal pairs with the growth seen at many other journals in the ACS portfolio. Interestingly, the growth registered in the past 2−3 years is not confined to the journals that specialize in chemical informatics: the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, and, to some extent, the Journal of Physical Chemistry C. It also encompasses journals in the materials sciences, the physical sciences, measurement science, chemical engineering, and environmental science in the broader ACS portfolio (Figure 1). Looking at the wider publication landscape, the Directory of Open Access Journal lists 65 journal entries for scientific publications that pertain to the topic of AI. Eleven of these were added in the last year alone, and this includes only those journals queried in the computational science category. In addition to these, numerous other open access, broader scope journals also publish work without any perceived evaluation of immediate impact and where existing AI tools have been successfully applied to a variety of chemistry questions. Over the past 10 to 15 years, AI, especially deep learning, has effected dramatic technological progress and proven success in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, common sense knowledge, strategic reasoning, and robotics. Exceptional results have also been reported in the medical sciences; for example, deep neural networks facilitated accurate diagnosis of skin cancer, and deep learning enabled extraction of new knowledge from old data, enabling accurate prediction of age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, and heart attack propensity of individuals just by analyzing previously acquired retinal images. But, what about the status of AI and its perception in chemistry? In the ensuing text, as an entreé to the associated Virtual Issue, I will present a brief overview of the perceived usefulness of AI at this time in some fields of the chemical sciences and related areas, based on recently published reviews and perspectives by experts in the area, as well as other resources. A review by Baum et al. charted the growth and distribution of AI-related chemistry publications in the last two decades using the CAS Content Collection, which includes patents as well as research articles. In their paper, they refer to the “Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies”, and from the data gathered, they determine that AI adoption in life sciences and analytical chemistry has navigated the so-called “peak of inflated expectations” and “trough of disillusionment” and successfully progressed to the “plateau of productivity”. It is common to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate it in the long run (anecdotally known as Amara’s law). For example, despite commercial interests and consequent investments being enormous, to this day, no new drug has yet been synthesized using AI. As another (counter) example, Peiretti and Brunel, in their Perspective published in 2018, ponder whether organic chemistry and in particular retrosynthesis might be the ideal next application of AI techniques. After all, it “f its perfectly” the definition of AI as a problem with “complex input−output relationships [that] are dif f icult or impractical to model procedurally”. However, Baum et al. firmly assess that “there are still areas of Chemistry like organic synthetic chemistry where AI is yet to make an impact”. Still, work is in progress, as standardized formats for reporting a chemical synthesis procedure are being developed and even classified (an essential step for scientific fields to exist) in the new taxonomy of digital chemistry or chemputation. At this stage in the discussion, it may be interesting to explore what the drivers are to greater or lesser success in applying AI methods to scientific problems. This point is examined in the Editorial by Jones et al., which accompanies an excellent JACS Au special collection on “Emerging Chemistry & Machine Learning”. In their overview, three main reasons are indicated. Two of them are quite intrinsic to the method (algorithm development and theoretical derivation of descriptors), while one of them is, notably, not specific but resides in the availability of a collection of standardized, highquality data. A case in point, and unanimously defined as the most spectacular recent success of AI, is the recent prediction of a protein’s three-dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence via AlphaFold. The tool was trained on large publicly available databases, such as the RSCB Protein Data Bank, as well as protein sequences of unknown structure. In return, it is somewhat expected, although not guaranteed, that the new information generated is also made available to the public. The AlphaFold code is now publicly available. It can}

Our evidence selection mechanism allows it to transcend the input length limitation of modern BERT-like Transformer models while presenting the entire evidence together for inferential reasoning. We show this is an important property needed to reason on large documents where the evidence may be fragmented and located arbitrarily far from each other. Extensive experiments on popular corpora - DocNLI, ContractNLI, and ConTRoL datasets, and our new proposed dataset called CaseHoldNLI on the task of legal judicial reasoning, demonstrate significant performance gains of 8-12% over SOTA methods. Our ablation studies validate the impact of our model. Performance improvement of 3-6% on annotation-scarce downstream tasks of fact verification, multiple-choice QA, and contract clause retrieval demonstrates the usefulness of DocInfer beyond primary NLI tasks.}

  abstract={Large-scale neural network models combining text and images have made incredible progress in recent years. However, it remains an open question to what extent such models encode compositional representations of the concepts over which they operate, such as correctly identifying ‘red cube’ by reasoning over the constituents ‘red’ and ‘cube’. In this work, we focus on the ability of a large pretrained vision and language model (CLIP) to encode compositional concepts and to bind variables in a structure-sensitive way (e.g., differentiating ‘cube behind sphere’ from ‘sphere behind cube’). To inspect the performance of CLIP, we compare several architectures from research on compositional distributional semantics models (CDSMs), a line of research that attempts to implement traditional compositional linguistic structures within embedding spaces. We benchmark them on three synthetic datasets – single-object, two-object, and relational – designed to test concept binding. We find that CLIP can compose concepts in a single-object setting, but in situations where concept binding is needed, performance drops dramatically. At the same time, CDSMs also perform poorly, with best performance at chance level.}

Despite decades of research on automation and proof assistants, writing formal proofs remains arduous and only accessible to a few experts. While previous studies to automate formalization focused on powerful search algorithms, no attempts were made to take advantage of available informal proofs. In this work, we introduce Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP), a method that maps informal proofs to formal proof sketches, and uses the sketches to guide an automated prover by directing its search to easier sub-problems. We investigate two relevant setups where informal proofs are either written by humans or generated by a language model. Our experiments and ablation studies show that large language models are able to produce well-structured formal sketches that follow the same reasoning steps as the informal proofs. Guiding an automated prover with these sketches enhances its performance from 20.9% to 39.3% on a collection of mathematical competition problems.}

  abstract={Mathematical reasoning, a core ability of human intelligence, presents unique challenges for machines in abstract thinking and logical reasoning. Recent large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have achieved remarkable progress on mathematical reasoning tasks written in text form, such as math word problems (MWP). However, it is unknown if the models can handle more complex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information, such as tabular data. To fill the gap, we present Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), a new dataset containing 38,431 open-domain grade-level problems that require mathematical reasoning on both textual and tabular data. Each question in TabMWP is aligned with a tabular context, which is presented as an image, semi-structured text, and a structured table. There are two types of questions: free-text and multi-choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions to reveal the multi-step reasoning process. We evaluate different pre-trained models on TabMWP, including the GPT-3 model in a few-shot setting. As earlier studies suggest, since few-shot GPT-3 relies on the selection of in-context examples, its performance is unstable and can degrade to near chance. The unstable issue is more severe when handling complex problems like TabMWP. To mitigate this, we further propose a novel approach, PromptPG, which utilizes policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data and then constructs the corresponding prompt for the test example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.31% on the accuracy metric and reduces the prediction variance significantly compared to random selection, which verifies its effectiveness in selecting in-context examples.}

The authors of this article have considered the main disadvantages and benefits of existing forecasting dimensions, as well as individual methods and models. They indicated ways to facilitate the implementation of currency exchange rate forecasting using neural networks with software libraries for various programming languages and individual software applications, as well. As a result, the authors have systematized knowledge about existing approaches used in the process of currency exchange rate forecasting. There are two dimensions of currency exchange rate forecasting, in particular, intuitive and formalized ones. The intuitive dimension is peculiar to short-term forecasting and is often used in trading. Its main advantages include the ability to consider structural changes in the economy that can significantly affect the exchange rate formation itself and the speed of forecasting. However, the disadvantage of intuitive methods is the inability to prove formally the quality of the obtained forecasts. The advantages of the formalized dimension of forecasting include the ability to prove the quality. Businesses and government agencies use it the most often. Extrapolation methods and machine learning methods are mainly used to predict the exchange rate using formalized methods. Moreover, the reviewed studies indicate that among the well-known extrapolation methods for predicting the exchange rate, autoregressive models (VAR, AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH, GARCH, ARDL) and smoothing methods (floating averages, adaptive methods and models) are used the most frequently. Machine learning methods include neural networks. Trend models have proved to be ineffective for currency exchange rate forecasting. The reason for this appeared to be using large amounts of data for currency exchange rate forecasting, and each fluctuation there directly affects the whole phenomenon.}

  abstract={The natural language model BERT uses a large-scale unsupervised corpus to accumulate rich linguistic knowledge during its pretraining stage, and then, the information is fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, which greatly improves the understanding capability of various natural language tasks. For some specific tasks, the capability of the model can be enhanced by introducing external knowledge. In fact, these methods, such as ERNIE, have been proposed for integrating knowledge graphs into BERT models, which significantly enhanced its capabilities in related tasks such as entity recognition. However, for two types of tasks, commonsense causal reasoning and predicting the ending of stories, few previous studies have combined model modification and process optimization to integrate external knowledge. Therefore, referring to ERNIE, in this paper, we propose enhanced language representation with event chains (EREC), which focuses on keywords in the text corpus and their implied relations. Event chains are integrated into EREC as external knowledge. Furthermore, various graph networks are used to generate embeddings and to associate keywords in the corpus. Finally, via multi-task training, external knowledge is integrated into the model generated in the pretraining stage so as to enhance the effect of the model in downstream tasks. The experimental process of the EREC model is carried out with a three-stage design, and the experimental results show that EREC has a deeper understanding of the causal relationship and event relationship contained in the text by integrating the event chains, and it achieved significant improvements on two specific tasks.}

  abstract={Welcome to Volume 51.2 of The Australian Journal of Indigenous Education. This is our second volume since our shift to being an open access journal. We are very pleased that AJIE has recently been accepted into the Directory of Open Access Journals and was awarded the DOAJ Seal for best practice in open access. DOAJ is an extensive index of diverse open access journals internationally and their aim is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally. We are also excited that since the journal became open access in August 2022 there has been over 20,000 views of whole articles and over 24,000 views of abstracts on our new open access website. 
This is a larger volume of AJIE than usual, and we thank the authors and reviewers for their contributions. You play a vital role in ensuring the quality of the journal. We would also like to thank Michelle James for her detailed and astute copyediting for the journal. Special thanks to Senior Publications Officer Sonia Nitchell for her continuing work on importing the large AJIE archive onto the new platform. 
The first suite of articles in this volume focuses on the early childhood context with articles by Locke and Webb providing us with insights into the inclusion of Indigenous knowledges and perspectives in early education and care settings in the first paper and how Aboriginal educators integrated their cultural knowledge and experiences to develop Aboriginal children’s skills in the second. In a South Saami context, Kroik explores preschool teachers’ identity as linguistic role models by means of analysing their own descriptions of language learning. In Canada, Schroeder et al. demonstrate the importance of making curricula relevant to Indigenous children by including content that is culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate. The interrelationships between language, identity and culture from Māori kaumātua (elders both male and female) and whānau (parents and extended family members) from Aotearoa (New Zealand) is explored by Berryman et al. 
The second suite of papers take us into the context of schools. Johnson and Flückiger explore the important role for Aboriginal Education Workers in remote Australian communities, while Goodall et al. draw on student and teacher memories of the early days of Indigenous-controlled adult education provider Tranby Aboriginal Co-operative Ltd. The paper by Guenther et al. analyses My School data for Very Remote Aboriginal schools, showing how the Remote School Attendance Strategy school attendance results compare with similar non-Remote School Attendance Strategy schools. Their findings raise ethical and accountability concerns about the Remote School Attendance Strategy, which they argue lacks evidence of attendance improvement, and which potentially causes harm. Whitau et al. also examine school attendance but in relation to Western Australian Aboriginal young women and the links between racism, teacher–student relationships, and peer connectedness, and how these were related to participant attendance and engagement at school. Moore et al. discuss the Whole of Community Engagement (WCE) initiative, which sought to identify barriers and enablers in Aboriginal students’ pathways to post-compulsory education in six remote communities in Arnhem Land and central Australia. They describe the features that led them to characterise the initiative and the remote community and school context as intercultural and complex. Also in relation to the Whole of Community Engagement initiative, Moore et al. propose an intercultural perspective as a refinement to the both-ways approach to remote education. Osborne et al. focus on aspirations of students, their families and communities at Nyangatjatjara College an independent Aboriginal school distributed across three campuses in the southern region of the Northern Territory. Macdonald and Gringart present a new measurement instrument, the Multi-Dimensional Student Perceptions of School Questionnaire (MSPSQ), validated with a moderate-sized sample of Indigenous and non-Indigenous secondary students in Western Australia. 
The next suite of papers has an international focus with papers from Canada, Aotearoa (New Zealand), Brazil, and Tonga. Stavrou and Murphy explore tensions surrounding Indigenising school mathematics in a Western Canadian prairie province conducted with three Cree elementary school teachers while Denston et al. examine teachers’ perceptions and experiences of a collaborative case study to adapt a literacy approach originally designed for an Aotearoa (New Zealand) English-medium context. Ioris et al. explore the main trends and pending gaps related to indigenous education in Brazil while Fonua et al. shares the stories of 26 successful Tongan science learners who participated in talanoa (open discussion without an agenda) about their engagement, enjoyment, and success in secondary and university science education in Aotearoa (New Zealand). 
The final papers in this volume shift to the university context with Hogarth exploring a small pilot study conducted at a Queensland university examining how academics perceive the inclusion of Indigenous Knowledges within institutional and professional contexts and initial teacher education programs. Forsyth et al. speak to the importance of employing Indigenous methodologies when conducting Indigenous research to improve dental and medical health outcomes for Indigenous peoples. Hook and Jessen reflect on the contentious nature of non-Indigenous academics teaching Indigenous Studies and draw on student survey data to illustrate the conflict between their pedagogic practices, student expectations and the structural impediments to their teaching aims. Smith et al. also provide a personal reflection on the higher education context by discussing the need to have institutional conversations about coloniality, institutional racism and white fragility within tertiary institutions. The final paper in this volume by Gibbs et al. explores the relationships between racism, cultural resilience, and educational engagement and academic outcomes for Aboriginal tertiary students. They highlight that cultural resilience and support is critical to Aboriginal student success within universities. Racism continues to be particularly important to address because, as the 2022 Australian Reconciliation Barometer recently highlighted, experiences of racial prejudice have increased for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the last two years and certainly there is much work needed to improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. 
We hope you enjoy reading the articles in this volume and hope the articles lead to further dialogue and discussion about Indigenous educational success both in Australia and internationally.

  abstract={Radiomics refers to a multistep process of feature extraction from medical images and their analysis by computer algorithms. The key idea is that the information contained in an image may not reveal itself by a naked eye but may become apparent through algorithms. This could lead to new imaging contrasts, perhaps because of the fundamentally different nature of how we, man and computer, arrive at image characterization—in the case of radiologists, the analysis relies on the wiring of a brain, whereas radiomics relies on simple but incremental mathematical operations. Furthermore, radiomics as a process can be divided into consecutive steps: acquisition of the medical images, identification of the volume of interest that relates to the pathology and its segmentation, extraction of relevant features describing the pathology, creating or sharing databases, and, finally, proposition with validation of predictive models. This is the main reason why radiomics holds the promise of discovering hidden correlations and bringing transparency into radiologists’ decisionmaking, respectively. One could summarize that radiomics is rather an approach than a specific method and that images are regarded as data rather than pictures. Radiomics is used to solve tasks by utilizing several families of features: these may be based on morphologic characteristics such as lesion size or volume, image intensity-based histograms or descriptors of the relationships between image voxels, such as gray-level co-occurrence, run-length, size-zone, or distance zone matrices. Features can also be extracted from images that are preprocessed by filters (eg, wavelet or Laplacian filters), as well as may stem from image fractal features. They can also be, however, based on machine learning techniques. One of such important tasks is a texture analysis—which is defined as a spatial distribution of an image that contains information on the local aspects of the tissue. To describe texture, we can use words in natural language such as coarseness, smoothness, or perhaps because it is difficult to grasp this concept in natural language a description by quantifiable features could be orthogonal and thus useful. MRI-based radiomics has already been applied in research, for example, to predict treatment response or outcome based on intensity histogram-based radiomic features. Radiomics could also bridge the gap between radiology and biology by correlating the features with underlying tumor genetics. Other applications include identification of malignant tissue, tumor classification, image guided radiotherapy, or distinguishing true progression from pseudo-progression. The results can be complementary to information obtained from histology, genotyping, laboratory results, clinical reports, or standard radiological reports or can be even corroborated in a decision support system. Although the possibilities of applications seem to be vast, and the theory is appealing, radiomics has not yet lived up to this promise and has not yet transitioned into the clinics because the key limitation of radiomics is its reproducibility. It is an issue even in the case when we use the same computational method and scan the participants on the same MR scanners! This is the question that is addressed in current issue of Journal of Magnetic Resonance in Imaging by the work titled “Investigation of the interand intra-scanner reproducibility and repeatability of radiomics features in magnetic resonance imaging” where the authors studied interand intra-scanner variability of radiomics variables in MRI trough multicenter validation. The authors found that, albeit few do, most of the radiomics features do not pass this minimal test! A way forward is to find a consensus on features that are reproducible, which is where this study contributes. However, one cannot be successful without a deeper understanding of the dependencies: the feature values depend both on parameter choices during calculations, but also on the parameters of the MR pulse-sequence. Based on this understanding, we can define features that are robust with respect to the dependencies. To further facilitate the data-driven approach, although challenging, it is crucial to create large and curated databases that also include a large span of the underlying dependencies. Because, if these are not at hand,}

  abstract={The main objective of this study was to test a structural theoretical model of the effects of self-regulated learning on academic stress, subjective well-being, and academic achievement in Secondary Education, considering academic procrastination as a mediator. An additional aim was to explore whether these relationships were moderated by gender and educational level. Participants were 728 students in compulsory and post-compulsory secondary education in a large city in Eastern Spain. Path analysis results indicated that the proposed model showed satisfactory fit, with the three dimensions of self-regulated learning significantly predicting the educational outcomes considered, and that procrastination mediated these relationships. Overall, the model is able to predict 9.8% of the variance of academic stress, 23.1% of students wellbeing, and 14% of academic achievement. Moreover, the multi-group routine revealed no moderation effects due to gender, but educational level moderated two relationships, between self-efficacy and academic achievement and between metacognitive strategies and procrastination. Additionally, supplementary models were tested for three specific subjects (Spanish Language, Foreign Language and Mathematics), which showed an improvement in explained variance, being respectively: 29%, 28% and 27%. Results are discussed in light of previous research and in terms of their impact on educational practice.}

  abstract={Vision and Language Pretraining has become the prevalent approach for tackling multimodal downstream tasks. The current trend is to move towards ever larger models and pretraining datasets. This computational headlong rush does not seem reasonable in the long term to move toward sustainable solutions, and de facto excludes academic laboratories with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new framework, dubbed ViCHA, that efficiently exploits the input data to boost the learning by: (a) a new hierarchical cross-modal alignment loss, (b) new self-supervised scheme based on masked image modeling, (c) leveraging image-level annotations, called Visual Concepts, obtained with existing foundation models such as CLIP to boost the performance of the image encoder. Although pretrained on four times less data, our ViCHA strategy outperforms other approaches on several downstream tasks such as Image-Text Retrieval, VQA, Visual Reasoning, Visual Entailment and Visual Grounding. The code will be made publicly available here: https://github.com/mshukor/ViCHA}

  abstract={Nowadays, pretrained language models (PLMs) have dominated the majority of NLP tasks. While, little research has been conducted on systematically evaluating the language abilities of PLMs. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study on general language ability evaluation of PLMs (ElitePLM). In our study, we design four evaluation dimensions, memory, comprehension, reasoning, and composition, to measure ten widely-used PLMs within five categories. Our empirical results demonstrate that: (1) PLMs with varying training objectives and strategies are good at different ability tests; (2) fine-tuning PLMs in downstream tasks is usually sensitive to the data size and distribution; (3) PLMs have excellent transferability between similar tasks. Moreover, the prediction results of PLMs in our experiments are released as an open resource for more deep and detailed analysis on the language abilities of PLMs. This paper can guide the future work to select, apply, and design PLMs for specific tasks. We have made all the details of experiments publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ElitePLM.}

  abstract={Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

  abstract={The recent advent of large language models has reinvigorated debate over whether human cognitive capacities might emerge in such generic models given sufficient training data. Of particular interest is the ability of these models to reason about novel problems zero-shot, without any direct training. In human cognition, this capacity is closely tied to an ability to reason by analogy. Here we performed a direct comparison between human reasoners and a large language model (the text-davinci-003 variant of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3) on a range of analogical tasks, including a non-visual matrix reasoning task based on the rule structure of Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices. We found that GPT-3 displayed a surprisingly strong capacity for abstract pattern induction, matching or even surpassing human capabilities in most settings; preliminary tests of GPT-4 indicated even better performance. Our results indicate that large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems. Webb et al. show that new artificial intelligence language models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, are able to solve analogical reasoning problems at a human-like level of performance.}

  abstract={In recent years, Neural Networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success in a variety of fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, autonomous driving, and healthcare [1] –[4]. However, conventional NNs rely heavily on large, labeled training datasets, which can lead to overfitting and overconfident decision making (especially when faced with unfamiliar, out-of-distribution inputs) [1] –[4]. Unlike conventional NNs, the weights of Bayesian Neural Network (BNNs) are represented by probability distributions, providing a mathematical framework to quantify the uncertainties in a model’s final prediction [3]. These uncertainty estimates allow BNNs to mitigate overfitting issues, enable training with smaller datasets, and help increase overall model accuracy through the implicit use of stochastic rounding [5]. Figure 1 shows an example with a BNN version of LeNet-5 [6], where weights of the network are represented by Gaussian distributions. The ambiguous digit is classified as a ‘5’ and ‘3’ with probabilities of 80% and 20%, respectively. However, these uncertainty estimates come at great computational cost, as multiple forward inference passes are required to generate the necessary posterior distributions. As such, BNNs require not only efficient, high-performance multiply-accumulation (MAC), but an efficient Gaussian Random Number Generator (GRNG) with high-quality statistics as well.}

Traditional communication system may use the technology of automatic repeat-request to deal with this problem, which is time consuming and a waste of resources. To enhance the reliability of the communication system, we investigate reasoning and decoding at the semantic level instead of the grammar level. In particular, we propose a semantic communication model for text transmission, assisting the communication system to be more robust in terrible channel environments. Based on the traditional communication system, the language model BERT, part of speech tagging, and prior information concerning bit-flipping are introduced to enhance the semantic reasoning ability of the transceiver. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the effects of the sub-strategies on the performances of the improved communication model, such as the existence of a candidate set and language model. The numerical results show the effectiveness of our model in terms of improving the semantic accuracy measured by BLUE, the METEOR score, and the similarity score based on BERT between transmitted messages and recovered messages.}

Given sufficient training data, large language models (LM) can learn the tabular structures and perform numerical reasoning well in question answering (QA). However, their performances fall significantly when data and computational resources are limited. This study improves this performance drop by infusing explicit tabular structures through a graph neural network (GNN). We proposed a model developed from the baseline of a financial QA dataset named TAT-QA. The baseline model, TagOp, consists of answer span (evidence) extraction and numerical reasoning modules. As our main contributions, we introduced two components to the model: a GNN-based evidence extraction module for tables and an improved numerical reasoning module. The latter provides a solution to TagOp’s arithmetic calculation problem specific to operations requiring number ordering, such as subtraction and division, which account for a large portion of numerical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that the graph module has the advantage in low-resource settings, while the improved numerical reasoning significantly outperforms the baseline model.}

  abstract={Developing problem-solving abilities is a major objective of learning mathematics at school. However, learners’ problem-solving abilities are still critical. The main purpose of this study was to investigate how the problem-based learning model could enhance learners’ problem-solving abilities in mathematics. The study used quasi-experimental research with one group pre-test-post-test design. The population in this study consisted of fifty-four grade eleven learners (aged between 16 to 19 years old) from one school in Kayonza District in Rwanda. Data were collected using mathematical problem-solving tests and interviews and were analysed using paired t-tests for dependent sample means and descriptive analysis. The study results indicate that problem-based learning potentially impacts learners’ problem-solving abilities. It is shown from learners’ work in problem-solving that all indicators of problem-solving abilities, namely understanding the problem, planning ways to approach the problem, monitoring the progress while tackling the problem and reviewing the solution process, emerged as being fairly well improved. In addition, based on the interview results from some learners and their teachers, they like the PBL model because embedded tasks helped them to apply the knowledge that can improve their reasoning, creativity and thinking capability. The study recommends that schools encourage teachers to adopt PBL for enhancing learners’ problem-solving abilities. Additionally, researchers are urged to use findings from this study as a reference for further research. Furthermore, researchers could conduct similar research on a large scale using different methodologies.}

Knowing the educational performance of schools is necessary to diagnose needs, evaluate proposals and undertake improvements in education policies. This study pursued a twofold objective: (1) to assess the equity and parity of Andalusian schools in relation to the competencies of mathematical reasoning and linguistic communication and (2) to study the relationship among educational performance, equity and parity in these competences. Hierarchical linear model research was designed and implemented in a population of 79,806 schoolchildren and 2092 schools. The results confirmed differences in equity and parity among schools. A relation was found between higher effectiveness and higher parity. Nonpublic schools are not more efficient than public schools; rather, it is the average economic and sociocultural status of schools that controls for their effectiveness. In conclusion, the educational system does not guarantee the same opportunities for all children; thus, the equity and parity of educational systems should be key criteria for their evaluation, ensuring that quality education reaches everyone equally. Further implications are also discussed.}

  abstract={Commonsense reasoning is an appealing topic in natural language processing (NLP) as it plays a fundamental role in supporting the human-like actions of NLP systems. With large-scale language models as the backbone, unsupervised pre-training on numerous corpora shows the potential to capture commonsense knowledge. Current pre-trained language model (PLM)-based reasoning follows the traditional practice using perplexity metric. However, commonsense reasoning is more than existing probability evaluation, which is biased by word frequency. This paper reconsiders the nature of commonsense reasoning and proposes a novel commonsense reasoning metric, Non-Replacement Confidence (NRC). In detail, it works on PLMs according to the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) pre-training objective in ELECTRA, in which the corruption detection objective reflects the confidence on contextual integrity that is more relevant to commonsense reasoning than existing probability. Our proposed novel method boosts zero-shot performance on two commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets and further seven commonsense question-answering datasets. Our analysis shows that pre-endowed commonsense knowledge, especially for RTD-based PLMs, is essential in downstream reasoning.}

  abstract={Existing pre-trained language models (PTLMs), like BERT, have shown their powerful ca-pabilities in many natural language processing tasks. In sequence analysis, such as time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and sentiment analysis, PTLMs have also achieved new state-of-the-art results. However, does this mean that PTLMs know sequence analysis? This paper explores whether BERT pre-trained on a large amount of data contains knowledge of sequence analysis. Specifically, we adopt prompt learning to see whether BERT will achieve good results on cloud-edge time series forecasting and sentiment analysis tasks. For the cloud-edge time series forecasting task, we give BERT some regular cloud-edge data and let it predict the features of the next time step; For the sentiment analysis task, we give BERT some sentence with sentiment and ask it what sentiment these sen-tences carry. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) BERT performs not well on the cloud-edge time series forecasting task, which means the logical reasoning of BERT is not good; (2) for sentiment analysis task, BERT with the prompt template performs poorly on both English and Chinese datasets; and (3) for sentiment analysis task, BERT appears to be more likely to perceive the text as carrying positive sentiment.}

  abstract={The 21st century is an era of rapid development of information and frequent international exchanges, and Japanese language teaching has received increasing attention. Because of this, colleges and universities are now focused on improving the quality of Japanese education, both now and in the future. We need to boost the whole management of teaching quality, notably the assessment of instructors’ teaching quality, in order to improve teaching quality. However, because a number of factors influence the quality of instruction, and each factor’s weight varies, the evaluation results are difficult to express in a mathematical analytical formula, resulting in a complex nonlinear classification problem that traditional classification methods cannot solve well. As a new technology, as a result of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) fundamental qualities, it has been extensively applied in different evaluation issues for pattern recognition, nonlinear classification, and other research. This subject introduces the optimized deep neural network theory into Japanese teaching quality evaluation and completes the following work: (1) the algorithm of discrete Hopfield neural network is introduced in detail, and the neural network theory is introduced into teaching evaluation. (2) Then, based on the evaluation data of teachers’ teaching quality in a school, a large number of simulation experiments and training were carried out, and a neural network model for evaluation of teachers’ teaching effect was constructed and designed. Experiments reveal that the neural network model proposed in this paper is a nonlinear mapping method, which increases the evaluation’s dependability and makes the outcomes more effective and objective.}

  abstract={Human speech production obeys the same acoustic principles as vocal production in other animals but has distinctive features: A stable vocal source is filtered by rapidly changing formant frequencies. To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy. Description Complexity from simplification Human speech and language are highly complex, consisting of a large number of sounds. The human phonal apparatus, the larynx, has acquired the capability to create a wider array of sounds, even though previous work has revealed many similarities between our larynx and those in other primates. Looking across a large number of primates, Nishimura et al. used a combination of anatomical, phonal, and modeling approaches to characterize sound production in the larynx (see the Perspective by Gouzoules). They found that instead of the human larynx having increased complexity, it has actually simplified relative to other primates, allowing for clearer sound production with less aural chaos. —SNV The human larynx has undergone evolutionary simplification, facilitating the increased acoustic complexity of the spoken language.}

  abstract={Background Vaccine hesitancy has been deemed one of the top 10 threats to global health. Antivaccine information on social media is a major barrier to addressing vaccine hesitancy. Understanding how vaccine proponents and opponents interact with each other on social media may help address vaccine hesitancy. Objective We aimed to examine conversations between vaccine proponents and opponents on Reddit to understand whether homophily in web-based conversations impedes opinion exchange, whether people are able to accommodate their languages to each other in web-based conversations, and whether engaging with opposing viewpoints stimulates higher levels of analytical thinking. Methods We analyzed large-scale conversational text data about human vaccines on Reddit from 2016 to 2018. Using deep neural network language models and computer-assisted conversational analyses, we obtained each Redditor’s stance on vaccines, each post’s stance on vaccines, each Redditor’s language coordination score, and each post or comment’s analytical thinking score. We then performed chi-square tests, 2-tailed t tests, and multilevel modeling to test 3 questions of interest. Results The results show that both provaccine and antivaccine Redditors are more likely to selectively respond to Redditors who indicate similar views on vaccines (P<.001). When Redditors interact with others who hold opposing views on vaccines, both provaccine and antivaccine Redditors accommodate their language to out-group members (provaccine Redditors: P=.044; antivaccine Redditors: P=.047) and show no difference in analytical thinking compared with interacting with congruent views (P=.63), suggesting that Redditors do not engage in motivated reasoning. Antivaccine Redditors, on average, showed higher analytical thinking in their posts and comments than provaccine Redditors (P<.001). Conclusions This study shows that although vaccine proponents and opponents selectively communicate with their in-group members on Reddit, they accommodate their language and do not engage in motivated reasoning when communicating with out-group members. These findings may have implications for the design of provaccine campaigns on social media.}

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have displayed an impressive ability to harness natural language to perform complex tasks. In this work, we explore whether we can leverage this learned ability to find and explain patterns in data. Specifically, given a pre-trained LLM and data examples, we introduce interpretable autoprompting (iPrompt), an algorithm that generates a natural-language string explaining the data. iPrompt iteratively alternates between generating explanations with an LLM and reranking them based on their performance when used as a prompt. Experiments on a wide range of datasets, from synthetic mathematics to natural-language understanding, show that iPrompt can yield meaningful insights by accurately finding groundtruth dataset descriptions. Moreover, the prompts produced by iPrompt are simultaneously human-interpretable and highly effective for generalization: on real-world sentiment classification datasets, iPrompt produces prompts that match or even improve upon human-written prompts for GPT-3. Finally, experiments with an fMRI dataset show the potential for iPrompt to aid in scientific discovery. All code for using the methods and data here is made available on Github.}

In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging the explanations generated by LLM to improve the training of small reasoners, which are more favorable in real-production deployment due to their low cost. We systematically explore three explanation generation approaches from LLM and utilize a multi-task learning framework to facilitate small models to acquire strong reasoning power together with explanation generation capabilities. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show that our method can consistently and significantly outperform finetuning baselines across different settings, and even perform better than finetuning/prompting a 60x larger GPT-3 (175B) model by up to 9.5% in accuracy. As a side benefit, human evaluation further shows that our method can generate high-quality explanations to justify its predictions, moving towards the goal of explainable AI.}

In this paper, we run careful empirical studies exploring the length generalization capabilities of transformer-based language models. We first establish that naively finetuning transformers on length generalization tasks shows significant generalization deficiencies independent of model scale. We then show that combining pretrained large language models' in-context learning abilities with scratchpad prompting (asking the model to output solution steps before producing an answer) results in a dramatic improvement in length generalization. We run careful failure analyses on each of the learning modalities and identify common sources of mistakes that highlight opportunities in equipping language models with the ability to generalize to longer problems.}

  abstract={Expressions that involve matrices and vectors, known as linear algebra expressions, are commonly evaluated through a sequence of invocations to highly optimised kernels provided in libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. A sequence of kernels represents an algorithm, and in general, because of associativity, algebraic identities, and multiple kernels, one expression can be evaluated via many different algorithms. These algorithms are all mathematically equivalent (i.e., in exact arithmetic, they all compute the same result), but often differ noticeably in terms of execution time. When faced with a decision, high-level languages, libraries, and tools such as Julia, Armadillo, and Linnea choose by selecting the algorithm that minimises the FLOP count. In this paper, we test the validity of the FLOP count as a discriminant for dense linear algebra algorithms, analysing ”anomalies”: problem instances for which the fastest algorithm does not perform the least number of FLOPs. To do so, we focused on relatively simple expressions and analysed when and why anomalies occurred. We found that anomalies exist and tend to cluster into large contiguous regions. For one expression anomalies were rare, whereas for the other they were abundant. We conclude that FLOPs is not a sufficiently dependable discriminant even when building algorithms with highly optimised kernels. Plus, most of the anomalies remained as such even after filtering out the inter-kernel cache effects. We conjecture that combining FLOP counts with kernel performance models will significantly improve our ability to choose optimal algorithms.}

FOLIO consists of 1,430 examples (unique conclusions), each paired with one of 487 sets of premises used to deductively reason for the validity of each conclusion. The logical correctness of the premises and conclusions is ensured by their FOL annotations, which are automatically verified by an FOL inference engine.

Our experiments on FOLIO systematically evaluate the FOL reasoning ability of supervised fine-tuning on medium-sized language models. For both NL reasoning and NL-FOL translation, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art language models. Our results show that a subset of FOLIO remains a challenge for one of the most capable Large Language Model (LLM) publicly available, GPT-4.}

MAGCC accomplishes this through: 1) the development of a comprehensively expressive formal knowledge representation knowledgebase, the Structured Scientific Knowledge Representation (SSKR) that encompasses all the types of information needed to make any simulation model, 2) the use of an artificially-intelligent logic-reasoning system, the Computational Modeling Assistant (CMA), that takes information from the SSKR and generates, in a traceable fashion, model specifications across a range of simulation modeling methods, and 3) the use of the CMA to generate compliable/executable code for a simulation model from those model specifications. The current MAGCC framework can be customized any scientific domain’s specific knowledgebase and existing mathematical/computational models, and future work will involve expanding the types of computational model representation that can be generated and integrating newly-developed code generating AI systems.}

  abstract={Although contemporary large language models (LMs) demonstrate impressive question-answering capabilities, their answers are typically the product of a single call to the model. This entails an unwelcome degree of opacity and compromises performance, especially on problems that are inherently multi-step. To address these limitations, we show how LMs can be made to perform faithful multi-step reasoning via a process whose causal structure mirrors the underlying logical structure of the problem. Our approach works by chaining together reasoning steps, where each step results from calls to two fine-tuned LMs, one for selection and one for inference, to produce a valid reasoning trace. Our method carries out a beam search through the space of reasoning traces to improve reasoning quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on multi-step logical deduction and scientific question-answering, showing that it outperforms baselines on final answer accuracy, and generates humanly interpretable reasoning traces whose validity can be checked by the user.}

  abstract={Recent neural models of code, such as OpenAI Codex and AlphaCode, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at code generation due to the underlying attention mechanism. However, it often remains unclear how the models actually process code, and to what extent their reasoning and the way their attention mechanism scans the code matches the patterns of developers. A poor understanding of the model reasoning process limits the way in which current neural models are leveraged today, so far mostly for their raw prediction. To fill this gap, this work studies how the processed attention signal of three open large language models - CodeGen, InCoder and GPT-J - agrees with how developers look at and explore code when each answers the same sensemaking questions about code. Furthermore, we contribute an open-source eye-tracking dataset comprising 92 manually-labeled sessions from 25 developers engaged in sensemaking tasks. We empirically evaluate five heuristics that do not use the attention and ten attention-based post-processing approaches of the attention signal of CodeGen against our ground truth of developers exploring code, including the novel concept of follow-up attention which exhibits the highest agreement between model and human attention. Our follow-up attention method can predict the next line a developer will look at with 47% accuracy. This outperforms the baseline prediction accuracy of 42.3%, which uses the session history of other developers to recommend the next line. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the attention signal of pre-trained models for effective code exploration.}

Existing developments offer some relief, however at the expense of inconvenient and error-prone term encodings and lack of formal foundations. We present a mathematically-inspired language-formalisation framework implemented in Agda. The system translates the description of a syntax signature with variable-binding operators into an intrinsically-encoded, inductive data type equipped with syntactic operations such as weakening and substitution, along with their correctness properties. The generated metatheory further incorporates metavariables and their associated operation of metasubstitution, which enables second-order equational/rewriting reasoning. The underlying mathematical foundation of the framework – initial algebra semantics – derives compositional interpretations of languages into their models satisfying the semantic substitution lemma by construction.}

  abstract={Monadic computations built by interpreting, or handling, operations of a free monad are a compelling formalism for modeling language semantics and defining the behaviors of effectful systems. The resulting layered semantics offer the promise of modular reasoning principles based on the equational theory of the underlying monads. However, there are a number of obstacles to using such layered interpreters in practice. With more layers comes more boilerplate and glue code needed to define the monads and interpreters involved. That overhead is compounded by the need to define and justify the relational reasoning principles that characterize the equivalences at each layer. This paper addresses these problems by significantly extending the capabilities of the Coq interaction trees (ITrees) library, which supports layered monadic interpreters. We characterize a rich class of interpretable monads---obtained by applying monad transformers to ITrees---and show how to generically lift interpreters through them. We also introduce a corresponding framework for relational reasoning about "equivalence of monads up to a relation R". This collection of typeclasses, instances, new reasoning principles, and tactics greatly generalizes the existing theory of the ITree library, eliminating large amounts of unwieldy boilerplate code and dramatically simplifying proofs.}

  abstract={
 Network graphs represent a general language for describing complex systems and a framework for knowledge discovery. Graph learning is a new concept with applications emerging in biomedicine, pharmacology, smart mobility, and physical reasoning. When applied to petroleum systems, such as reservoir models, graphs provide unique differentiators for the abstraction of reservoir connectivity to facilitate “reservoir-centric” machine learning (ML) applications.
 In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, the application of geoscience-based deep interaction networks (GeoDIN) to learn complex physics relationships from 3D reservoir models for fast and accurate prediction of subsurface spatio-temporal flow dynamics. We build the network graph with embedded subsurface and physics representations and train the ML model to “act like the reservoir simulator.”
 We use a simulation benchmark model for two-phase incompressible flow, with approximately 1.1 million grid size, one central injector, and four corner producers. Static 3D grid properties include porosity and permeability. We use full-physics simulation output to construct the interaction network (IN) graph, where graph nodes objects (nodes) represent reservoir grid cells. We embed the feature vector combining pore, oil and water volumes, and pressure and relative permeability. The graph objects representing wells are connected with well completion factors. The producing wells have embedded oil and water production rates, while the objects representing injecting wells have embedded water injection rates. We represent graph relations (edges) with bidirectional transmissibility of the source cell. To preprocess the data for ML, we scale the graph object attributes using “min-max” normalization and we normalize the graph relation attributes using Box-Cox transformation.
 We train the GeoDIN framework to predict oil and water saturation dynamics in space and time. When benchmarked with full-physics simulation, the INs ran on two V100 graphics processing units and substantially accelerated the prediction phase compared to the physics-based simulator running on 70 Intel Xeon E5 CPU cores. On average, the error in GeoDIN predicted spatio-temporal distribution of oil saturation remains within 5% of full-physics simulation for 90% of model grid cells, while the error in water saturation remains within 2.5% of full-physics simulation. The spatio-temporal propagation of pressure is more sensitive to local embeddings of INs, which communicate on node-to-node information transfer. This results in a larger prediction error of the GeoDIN model when benchmarked to full-physics simulation. On average, the error distribution suggests that the great majority (90 to 95%) of grid cells fall within 10 to 30% error bound relative to full-physics simulation.
 The presented GeoDIN approach to network learning carries a game-changing potential for the prediction of subsurface flow dynamics. As the way forward, we will investigate the implementation of graph neural networks with automated feature learning, generalization, and scaleup.}

  abstract={Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.}

  abstract={Reducing the representational discrepancy between source and target domains is a key component to maximize the model generalization. In this work, we advocate for leveraging natural language supervision for the domain generalization task. We introduce two modules to ground visual representations with texts containing typical reasoning of humans: (1) Visual and Textual Joint Embedder and (2) Textual Explanation Generator. The former learns the image-text joint embedding space where we can ground high-level class-discriminative information into the model. The latter leverages an explainable model and generates explanations justifying the rationale behind its decision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage the vision-and-language cross-modality approach for the domain generalization task. Our experiments with a newly created CUB-DG benchmark dataset demonstrate that cross-modality supervision can be successfully used to ground domain-invariant visual representations and improve the model generalization. Furthermore, in the large-scale DomainBed benchmark, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results and ranks 1st in average performance for five multi-domain datasets. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/mswzeus/GVRT.}

  abstract={Large, pretrained language models infer powerful representations that encode rich semantic and syntactic content, albeit implicitly. In this work we introduce a novel neural language model that enforces, via inductive biases, explicit relational structures which allow for compositionality onto the output representations of pretrained language models. Specifically, the model encodes sentences into sequences of symbols (composed representations), which correspond to the nodes visited by biased random walkers on a global latent graph, and infers the posterior distribution of the latter. We first demonstrate that the model is able to uncover ground-truth graphs from artificially generated datasets of random token sequences. Next, we leverage pretrained BERT and GPT-2 language models as encoder and decoder, respectively, to infer networks of symbols (schemata) from natural language datasets. Our experiments show that (i) the inferred symbols can be interpreted as encoding different aspects of language, as e.g. topics or sentiments, and that (ii) GPT-2-like models can effectively be conditioned on symbolic representations. Finally, we explore training autoregressive, random walk “reasoning” models on schema networks inferred from commonsense knowledge databases, and using the sampled paths to enhance the performance of pretrained language models on commonsense If-Then reasoning tasks.}

  abstract={Despite extensive research both on the theoretical and practical fronts, formalising, reasoning about, and implementing languages with variable binding is still a daunting endeavour – repetitive boilerplate and the overly complicated metatheory of capture-avoiding substitution often get in the way of progressing on to the actually interesting properties of a language. Existing developments offer some relief, however at the expense of inconvenient and error-prone term encodings and lack of formal foundations. We present a mathematically-inspired language-formalisation framework implemented in Agda. The system translates the description of a syntax signature with variable-binding operators into an intrinsically-encoded, inductive data type equipped with syntactic operations such as weakening and substitution, along with their correctness properties. The generated metatheory further incorporates metavariables and their associated operation of metasubstitution, which enables second-order equational/rewriting reasoning. The underlying mathematical foundation of the framework – initial algebra semantics – derives compositional interpretations of languages into their models satisfying the semantic substitution lemma by construction.}

  abstract={Monadic computations built by interpreting, or handling, operations of a free monad are a compelling formalism for modeling language semantics and defining the behaviors of effectful systems. The resulting layered semantics offer the promise of modular reasoning principles based on the equational theory of the underlying monads. However, there are a number of obstacles to using such layered interpreters in practice. With more layers comes more boilerplate and glue code needed to define the monads and interpreters involved. That overhead is compounded by the need to define and justify the relational reasoning principles that characterize the equivalences at each layer. This paper addresses these problems by significantly extending the capabilities of the Coq interaction trees (ITrees) library, which supports layered monadic interpreters. We characterize a rich class of interpretable monads---obtained by applying monad transformers to ITrees---and show how to generically lift interpreters through them. We also introduce a corresponding framework for relational reasoning about "equivalence of monads up to a relation R". This collection of typeclasses, instances, new reasoning principles, and tactics greatly generalizes the existing theory of the ITree library, eliminating large amounts of unwieldy boilerplate code and dramatically simplifying proofs.}

To preprocess the data for ML, we scale the graph object attributes using “min-max” normalization and we normalize the graph relation attributes using Box-Cox transformation.
 We train the GeoDIN framework to predict oil and water saturation dynamics in space and time. When benchmarked with full-physics simulation, the INs ran on two V100 graphics processing units and substantially accelerated the prediction phase compared to the physics-based simulator running on 70 Intel Xeon E5 CPU cores. On average, the error in GeoDIN predicted spatio-temporal distribution of oil saturation remains within 5% of full-physics simulation for 90% of model grid cells, while the error in water saturation remains within 2.5% of full-physics simulation. The spatio-temporal propagation of pressure is more sensitive to local embeddings of INs, which communicate on node-to-node information transfer. This results in a larger prediction error of the GeoDIN model when benchmarked to full-physics simulation. On average, the error distribution suggests that the great majority (90 to 95%) of grid cells fall within 10 to 30% error bound relative to full-physics simulation.
 The presented GeoDIN approach to network learning carries a game-changing potential for the prediction of subsurface flow dynamics. As the way forward, we will investigate the implementation of graph neural networks with automated feature learning, generalization, and scaleup.}

  abstract={Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.}

In this work we introduce a novel neural language model that enforces, via inductive biases, explicit relational structures which allow for compositionality onto the output representations of pretrained language models. Specifically, the model encodes sentences into sequences of symbols (composed representations), which correspond to the nodes visited by biased random walkers on a global latent graph, and infers the posterior distribution of the latter. We first demonstrate that the model is able to uncover ground-truth graphs from artificially generated datasets of random token sequences.

=== INTRODUCTION ===
\section{Introduction}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, from text generation to complex question answering \cite{brown2020language}. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are increasingly being applied is mathematical reasoning. The ability to understand, process, and generate mathematical content is fundamental to scientific discovery, engineering, finance, and many aspects of daily life. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of robust mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing goal in the field of AI \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The systematic analysis of reasoning processes, whether in natural language \cite{stolfo2022causalframework, yu2022analysiscorrelation}, formal logic \cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis, carette2022centralsubmonads}, or applied domains like clinical reasoning \cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}, is crucial for advancing AI capabilities. The design of supplementary mathematics modules, for instance, aims to improve students' reasoning abilities \cite{heru2022designsupplementary}.

Recent advancements in LLMs, particularly those based on transformer architectures \cite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened new avenues for tackling complex mathematical problems. These models, trained on massive datasets, possess an emergent ability to perform arithmetic operations, solve algebraic equations, and even engage with more abstract mathematical concepts \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, wei2022chainofthought}. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remain active areas of research. Issues such as susceptibility to superficial patterns in problem descriptions \cite{stolfo2022causalframework}, the need for explicit reasoning capabilities \cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}, and challenges in out-of-distribution generalization \cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} highlight the ongoing challenges. The development of AI-assisted programming further underscores the integration of AI with structured problem-solving \cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}. Furthermore, understanding the information-theoretic aspects of neural scaling laws \cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}, developing frameworks for formal methods \cite{khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations}, and autoformalizing mathematical problems \cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural} are critical for advancing rigorous reasoning systems. The generation of synthetic data for training models \cite{zhang2022automaticchain, shridhar2022automaticgeneration} and the exploration of multimodal reasoning \cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense, smith2022constructvldatafree, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage, liu2022deplotoneshot, cho2022dallevalprobing} also contribute to this evolving landscape.

Research exploring counterfactual reasoning requires language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions, testing their understanding of causal relationships beyond real-world knowledge \cite{li2022counterfactualreasoning}. Constructing datasets for specific linguistic phenomena, such as Arabic reading comprehension, is also an ongoing effort \cite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria for impulse response functions highlights the application of mathematical reasoning in signal processing \cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit}. Continual learning in 3D point clouds aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge without forgetting past information, a challenge relevant to robust AI development \cite{zamorski2022continuallearning}. Contrastive language-image pre-training with knowledge graphs enhances multi-modal reasoning by injecting semantic information \cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}. ConvFinQA focuses on numerical reasoning in conversational finance question answering, posing challenges for modeling long-range numerical reasoning paths \cite{chen2022convfinqaexploring}. A correction to a paper on Dirac's theory of radiation discusses the inception and reception of tools for quantum field theorists, involving complex reasoning processes \cite{ehberger2022correctionlanguage}. Counterfactual decoding is explored for anti-hallucination knowledge-grounded dialogue generation \cite{chen2022counterfactualdecoding}. Creative mathematical reasoning and its relation to cognitive motivation are investigated \cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical}. Critical analysis of big data applications using functional linguistics and diversified integration explores advancements in artificial reasoning \cite{kumar2022criticalanalysis}. Cross-lingual speaker identification from weak local evidence is another area of AI application \cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker}. CrunchQA is a dataset for question answering over a knowledge graph, highlighting challenges in multi-hop reasoning \cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic}. Curriculum: A Broad-Coverage Benchmark for Linguistic Phenomena in Natural Language Understanding aims to diagnose models' linguistic skills \cite{chen2022curriculumbroadcoverage}. DALL-Eval probes reasoning skills and social biases of text-to-image transformers \cite{cho2022dallevalprobing}.

Emergent bilingual middle schoolers' syncretic reasoning in statistical modeling is also a significant area of research \cite{radke2022emergentbilingual}. Furthermore, the emergent analogical reasoning capabilities of large language models are being explored \cite{webb2022emergentanalogical}. Energy-efficient Bayesian Neural Network accelerators are investigated \cite{dorrance2022energyefficient}. English proficiency and its impact on immigrant occupations are examined \cite{adser2022englishproficiency}. Enhancing communication reliability from the semantic level under low SNR is explored \cite{liu2022enhancingcommunication}. Enhancing financial table and text question answering with tabular graph and numerical reasoning is a key contribution \cite{nararatwong2022enhancingfinancial}. Enhancing upper secondary learners' problem-solving abilities using problem-based learning in mathematics is explored \cite{dorimana2022enhancingupper}. Equity and parity in primary education are studied using hierarchical linear models \cite{lucasoliva2022equityparity}. Erupting arc volcanoes are analyzed using unsupervised machine learning \cite{boschetty2022eruptingvolcano}. EvEntS ReaLM investigates event reasoning of entity states via language models \cite{spiliopoulou2022eventsrealm}. Evaluating confidence instead of perplexity for zero-shot commonsense reasoning is a novel approach \cite{peng2022evaluateconfidence}. Evaluating BERT on time series forecasting and sentiment analysis via prompt learning is conducted \cite{li2022evaluatingbert}. Evaluation of Japanese teaching quality is based on deep neural networks \cite{liu2022evaluationjapanese}.

This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research at the intersection of large language models, mathematical reasoning, and related AI reasoning techniques. We address the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the primary tasks and datasets used to evaluate AI models in mathematical and logical reasoning?
    \item What are the dominant methodologies and architectures employed to enhance AI reasoning performance?
    \item What are the key findings and limitations of current research in this area, including aspects of robustness, generalization, interpretability, and bias?
    \item What are the promising future research directions for AI in mathematical and logical reasoning?

To address these questions, we conducted a systematic search of the literature. Our methodology, detailed in the following section, adheres to the principles of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement \cite{moher2009preferred} to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We focused on original research articles that specifically investigated the application of LLMs and related AI techniques to mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. This includes research on multimodal reasoning \cite{ji2022afrbertattentionbased, an2022bevbertmultimodal, wan2022bridgingbetween, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial, wang2022chiqalarge, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, kim2022cosimcommonsense, smith2022constructvldatafree, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage, liu2022deplotoneshot, cho2022dallevalprobing, shukor2022efficientvisionlanguage}, educational assessment \cite{markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics, amaliyah2022analisiskesulitan, shidqiya2022analysisstudents, wilson2022classificationopenended, xiao2022auxiliaryteaching, kogan2022assessingacademic, jonsson2022creativemathematical, nuraina2022desainbahan, lucasoliva2022equityparity}, and various reasoning frameworks \cite{yu2022alertadapt, stolfo2022causalframework, kim2022cosimcommonsense, raman2022capecorrective, lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset, li2022eliteplmempirical}. The investigation into the foundational models' causal reasoning capabilities \cite{willig2022foundationmodels} and the nuances of in-context learning \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations} are central to understanding AI reasoning. Benchmarking of various systems \cite{si2022benchmarkinggpt3, srivastava2022beyondimitation, gopinath2022benchmarkinglargescale, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial} is also a key aspect.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details our methodology. Section 3 presents the results of our literature search, organized thematically. Section 4 discusses the findings, identifies research gaps, and outlines implications and future directions. Finally, Section 5 concludes the review by summarizing the key contributions and insights.

\subsection{Study Selection}

Following the initial search, all retrieved records (462 identified) were imported into a reference management software. Titles and abstracts were systematically screened based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of potentially relevant articles were then retrieved and assessed for final inclusion. This process resulted in the inclusion of 165 papers in this review.

\subsection{Core Tasks and Datasets in Mathematical and Logical Reasoning}

The evaluation of AI models in reasoning tasks relies on a variety of benchmarks and problem types. These can be broadly categorized as follows:

* \ex{Arithmetic, Algebraic, and Mathematical Word Problems:} These tasks form the core of quantitative reasoning evaluations. Datasets like GSM8K and MATH \cite{kobelski2022rethinking, hendrycks2021math} are frequently used to assess LLMs' ability to perform calculations, solve equations, and interpret natural language descriptions of mathematical scenarios. Surveys such as \cite{lu2022surveydeep} provide a comprehensive overview of these tasks and associated datasets.

\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}

Researchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:

### Integration of External Tools and Knowledge

Hybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}.

\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}

Researchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:

### Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

Techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \cite{kar2022arggenprompting}. CAPE utilizes LLMs for corrective actions from precondition errors in planning \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Curriculum learning based prompt tuning (CUP) is applied for implicit event argument extraction \cite{lin2022curriculumlearning}. The question of whether in-context learners can learn a reasoning concept from demonstrations is investigated \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations}. Auto-CoT is proposed for automatic chain of thought prompting \cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. Complexity-based prompting is explored for multi-step reasoning \cite{fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. Decomposed prompting offers a modular approach for complex tasks \cite{khot2022decomposedprompting}.

Discursive Socratic Questioning aims to interpret neural language models for discourse understanding \cite{aralikatte2022discursivesocratic}. Evaluating BERT on cloud-edge time series forecasting and sentiment analysis via prompt learning is conducted \cite{li2022evaluatingbert}.

### Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation

Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalized Vision and Language (PerVL) models address user-specific concepts by extending input vocabulary \cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}. Adaptive language models to reasoning tasks are explored \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Model transformation languages are compared \cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}.

### Integration of External Tools and Knowledge

Hybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Vadalog is a system designed for reasoning over large knowledge graphs \cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. Retriever-augmented language models are studied for their reasoning capabilities \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Composing ensembles of pre-trained models via iterative consensus is proposed \cite{li2022composingensembles}. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training with Knowledge Graphs is also a relevant study \cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}.

### Formal Methods and Structured Reasoning

Formal methods are employed to ensure rigor and correctness. Petri nets enhance clinical reasoning \cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}. Executable formal models, such as for VHDL \cite{khan2022executableformal}, enable formal reasoning about designs. Experimentation frameworks for web service verification use declarative, mathematical formalisms \cite{katra2022experimentationframework}.

### Causal Reasoning, Robustness, and Generalization

Ensuring model robustness is a critical concern. Causal frameworks help understand the influence of different input factors on model output, preventing reliance on spurious correlations \cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Achieving and understanding out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in systematic reasoning is investigated using small-scale transformers \cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding}. Autoformalization for neural theorem proving aims to bridge the gap between neural and formal methods \cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural}. Investigating causality in foundation models is also a focus \cite{willig2022foundationmodels}. Transformer models' reasoning in natural language fragments is studied in relation to robustness \cite{schlegel2022transformersreason}. CAPE generates corrective actions from precondition errors \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Counterfactual reasoning studies whether language models need world knowledge for causal understanding \cite{li2022counterfactualreasoning}. Debiasing NLU models via causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning is proposed \cite{tian2022debiasingmodels}. Effects of self-regulated learning and procrastination on academic outcomes are examined \cite{garcaros2022effectsselfregulated}. FCM: Forgetful Causal Masking makes causal language models better zero-shot learners \cite{liu2022forgetfulcausal}. FLOPs as a discriminant for dense linear algebra algorithms is studied \cite{lopez2022flopsdiscriminant}.

\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}

Researchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:

### Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

Techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \cite{kar2022arggenprompting}. CAPE utilizes LLMs for corrective actions from precondition errors in planning \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Curriculum learning based prompt tuning (CUP) is applied for implicit event argument extraction \cite{lin2022curriculumlearning}. The question of whether in-context learners can learn a reasoning concept from demonstrations is investigated \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations}. Auto-CoT is proposed for automatic chain of thought prompting \cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. Complexity-based prompting is explored for multi-step reasoning \cite{fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. Decomposed prompting offers a modular approach for complex tasks \cite{khot2022decomposedprompting}.

Discursive Socratic Questioning aims to interpret neural language models for discourse understanding \cite{aralikatte2022discursivespectives}. Evaluating BERT on cloud-edge time series forecasting and sentiment analysis via prompt learning is conducted \cite{li2022evaluatingbert}.

### Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation

Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalized Vision and Language (PerVL) models address user-specific concepts by extending input vocabulary \cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}. Adaptive language models to reasoning tasks are explored \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Model transformation languages are compared \cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}.

### Integration of External Tools and Knowledge

Hybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Vadalog is a system designed for reasoning over large knowledge graphs \cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. Retriever-augmented language models are studied for their reasoning capabilities \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Composing ensembles of pre-trained models via iterative consensus is proposed \cite{li2022composingensembles}. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training with Knowledge Graphs is also a relevant study \cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}.

### Formal Methods and Structured Reasoning

Formal methods are employed to ensure rigor and correctness. Petri nets enhance clinical reasoning \cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}. Executable formal models, such as for VHDL \cite{khan2022executableformal}, enable formal reasoning about designs. Experimentation frameworks for web service verification use declarative, mathematical formalisms \cite{katra2022experimentationframework}.

### Causal Reasoning, Robustness, and Generalization

Ensuring model robustness is a critical concern. Causal frameworks help understand the influence of different input factors on model output, preventing reliance on spurious correlations \cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Achieving and understanding out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in systematic reasoning is investigated using small-scale transformers \cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding}. Autoformalization for neural theorem proving aims to bridge the gap between neural and formal methods \cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural}. Investigating causality in foundation models is also a focus \cite{willig2022foundationmodels}. Transformer models' reasoning in natural language fragments is studied in relation to robustness \cite{schlegel2022transformersreason}. CAPE generates corrective actions from precondition errors \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Counterfactual reasoning studies whether language models need world knowledge for causal understanding \cite{li2022counterfactualreasoning}. Debiasing NLU models via causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning is proposed \cite{tian2022debiasingmodels}. Effects of self-regulated learning and procrastination on academic outcomes are examined \cite{garcaros2022effectsselfregulated}. FCM: Forgetful Causal Masking makes causal language models better zero-shot learners \cite{liu2022forgetfulcausal}. FLOPs as a discriminant for dense linear algebra algorithms is studied \cite{lopez2022flopsdiscriminant}.

\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}

Researchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:

### Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

Techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \cite{kar2022arggenprompting}. CAPE utilizes LLMs for corrective actions from precondition errors in planning \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Curriculum learning based prompt tuning (CUP) is applied for implicit event argument extraction \cite{lin2022curriculumlearning}. The question of whether in-context learners can learn a reasoning concept from demonstrations is investigated \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations}. Auto-CoT is proposed for automatic chain of thought prompting \cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. Complexity-based prompting is explored for multi-step reasoning \cite{fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. Decomposed prompting offers a modular approach for complex tasks \cite{khot2022decomposedprompting}. Counterfactual decoding is explored for anti-hallucination knowledge-grounded dialogue generation \cite{chen2022counterfactualdecoding}. Discursive Socratic Questioning aims to interpret neural language models for discourse understanding \cite{aralikatte2022discursivespectives}. Evaluating BERT on cloud-edge time series forecasting and sentiment analysis via prompt learning is conducted \cite{li2022evaluatingbert}.

### Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation

Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalized Vision and Language (PerVL) models address user-specific concepts by extending input vocabulary \cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}. Adaptive language models to reasoning tasks are explored \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Model transformation languages are compared \cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}. Continual learning on 3D point clouds is explored with random compressed rehearsal \cite{zamorski2022continuallearning}. Evolution of Technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is discussed \cite{b2022evolutiontechnology}. Examining Homophily, Language Coordination, and Analytical Thinking in Web-Based Conversations About Vaccines on Reddit is analyzed \cite{li2022examininghomophily}.

Exploring Length Generalization in Large Language Models is conducted \cite{anil2022exploringlength}.

### Integration of External Tools and Knowledge

Hybrid approaches combine LLMs with external tools like calculators, symbolic solvers (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), or knowledge graphs. This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}. Vadalog is a system designed for reasoning over large knowledge graphs \cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. Retriever-augmented language models are studied for their reasoning capabilities \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Composing ensembles of pre-trained models via iterative consensus is proposed \cite{li2022composingensembles}. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training with Knowledge Graphs is also a relevant study \cite{pan2022contrastivelanguageimage}.

### Formal Methods and Structured Reasoning

Formal methods are employed to ensure rigor and correctness. Petri nets enhance clinical reasoning \cite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}. Executable formal models, such as for VHDL \cite{khan2022executableformal}, enable formal reasoning about designs. Experimentation frameworks for web service verification use declarative, mathematical formalisms \cite{katra2022experimentationframework}. A semiotic analysis assesses the usefulness and limitations of multiple systems of logic \cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis}. Neuro-symbolic story understanding is explored using code-based structured prompting \cite{dong2022corrpuscodebased}.

\subsection{Methodologies for Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities}

Researchers employ a diverse set of methodologies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems:

### Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

Techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have been highly effective in enabling LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving performance on complex tasks \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}. The ALERT framework specifically aims to adapt language models to reasoning tasks through prompt-based methods \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Answer-level calibration (ALC) is proposed for free-form question answering to model and remove context-independent biases \cite{kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. Prompt-based text generation is used for document-level event-argument aggregation \cite{kar2022arggenprompting}. CAPE utilizes LLMs for corrective actions from precondition errors in planning \cite{raman2022capecorrective}. Curriculum learning based prompt tuning (CUP) is applied for implicit event argument extraction \cite{lin2022curriculumlearning}.

### Fine-tuning and Model Adaptation

Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Personalized Vision and Language (PerVL) models address user-specific concepts by extending input vocabulary \cite{cohen2022thisunicorn}. Adaptive language models to reasoning tasks are explored \cite{yu2022alertadapt}. Model transformation languages are compared \cite{hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages}.

Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific reasoning datasets, such as mathematical problem-solving corpora, is a common strategy to adapt models to specialized tasks \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking}. This contrasts with zero-shot approaches that use pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, demonstrating competitive performance \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}.

This leverages the LLM's natural language understanding with the precision of specialized systems \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KE-PLMs) integrate parametric knowledge with external sources like knowledge graphs \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}. Empirical investigations into commonsense self-supervision with knowledge graphs explore these integrations \cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation}.

=== DISCUSSION ===
\section{Discussion}

The collected 165 papers reveal a dynamic and rapidly evolving research landscape at the nexus of AI, particularly LLMs, and structured reasoning, including mathematical, logical, causal, multimodal, and educational domains. The findings underscore significant progress in AI's ability to perform quantitative tasks, ranging from basic arithmetic and algebraic problem-solving \cite{lu2022surveydeep, kobelski2022rethinking, lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset} to sophisticated mathematical word problems \cite{alghamdi2022armathdataset, shridhar2022automaticgeneration, wei2022chainofthought, chen2022convfinqaexploring}. Methodologies such as chain-of-thought prompting \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, fine-tuning on specialized datasets \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}, and the integration of external knowledge \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage} have been pivotal in achieving these advancements.

A recurring theme is the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques like CoT for eliciting step-by-step reasoning \cite{yu2022alertadapt, raman2022capecorrective}. This moves beyond mere pattern matching towards more transparent problem-solving processes. The combination of LLMs with formal methods, symbolic solvers, and knowledge graphs represents a powerful paradigm for leveraging the strengths of both neural and symbolic AI \cite{lu2022surveydeep, khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, wu2022autoformalizationwith, bellomarini2022overviewvadalog}. The development of systems like Vadalog for knowledge graph reasoning \cite{bellomarini2022overviewvadalog} further exemplifies this trend. The ability of transformers to reason in fragments of natural language \cite{schlegel2022transformersreason} and the exploration of in-context learning \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners, ye2022complementaryexplanations} contribute to understanding the fundamental reasoning capabilities of these models. Research on code as policies for embodied control \cite{liang2022codepolicies} and semantic queries over code \cite{sahu2022codequeriesdataset} demonstrates reasoning capabilities in programming contexts. Distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller models is a key future direction \cite{shridhar2022distillingreasoning}.

Despite these successes, several challenges and research gaps remain prominent. \ex{Robustness} is a critical concern, as highlighted by studies demonstrating that models can still rely on superficial cues rather than deep understanding \cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Ensuring true mathematical reasoning, rather than mimicry, requires models that are resilient to variations in problem presentation and robust against adversarial manipulations \cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}. Research on achieving out-of-distribution generalization \cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} and understanding the causal underpinnings of reasoning \cite{stolfo2022causalframework, willig2022foundationmodels, li2022counterfactualreasoning, tian2022debiasingmodels} is essential to address this. The analysis of student self-assessment accuracy also points to robustness concerns in educational contexts \cite{markta2022accuracypupils}. Evaluating explanation regularization methods for NLP models is also important for understanding model behavior \cite{joshi2022ertestevaluating}.

\ex{Generalization to novel mathematical concepts and abstract reasoning} remains a significant hurdle \cite{lu2022surveydeep}. While current models excel in well-defined problem spaces, their ability to perform advanced theoretical reasoning, discover new mathematical principles, or adapt to entirely new domains is limited. Bridging this gap might involve deeper integration of structured knowledge \cite{hu2022surveyknowledge} and potentially new neuro-symbolic architectures \cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}. The BIG-bench benchmark aims to quantify and extrapolate capabilities beyond imitation \cite{srivastava2022beyondimitation}, highlighting areas where current models fall short. The limitations of retriever-augmented language models in reasoning are also noted \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Computer simulation of intelligent control systems \cite{khuralay2022computersimulation} and the use of hybrid algorithms for complex problems \cite{wang2022hybridgenetic, snchez2022clusteringapproach} also point to the challenges of generalization in applied domains. The development of efficient vision-language pretraining methods is explored \cite{shukor2022efficientvisionlanguage}. ElitePLM provides an empirical study on the general language ability evaluation of PLMs \cite{li2022eliteplmempirical}. Emergent bilingual students' syncretic reasoning in statistical modeling is also a key area \cite{radke2022emergentbilingual}. Emergent analogical reasoning in LLMs is investigated \cite{webb2022emergentanalogical}. Energy-efficient BNN accelerators are studied \cite{dorrance2022energyefficient}. Enhancing communication reliability through semantic understanding is proposed \cite{liu2022enhancingcommunication}. Enhancing financial table and text question answering with tabular graph and numerical reasoning is a key focus \cite{nararatwong2022enhancingfinancial}. Enhancing upper secondary learners' problem-solving abilities using problem-based learning in mathematics is explored \cite{dorimana2022enhancingupper}. Equity and parity in primary education are studied using hierarchical linear models \cite{lucasoliva2022equityparity}. Erupting arc volcanoes are analyzed using unsupervised machine learning \cite{boschetty2022eruptingvolcano}. EvEntS ReaLM investigates event reasoning of entity states via language models \cite{spiliopoulou2022eventsrealm}. Evaluating confidence instead of perplexity for zero-shot commonsense reasoning is a novel approach \cite{peng2022evaluateconfidence}. Evaluating BERT on time series forecasting and sentiment analysis via prompt learning is conducted \cite{li2022evaluatingbert}. Evaluation of Japanese teaching quality is based on deep neural networks \cite{liu2022evaluationjapanese}. Evolution of Technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is discussed \cite{b2022evolutiontechnology}. Examining Homophily, Language Coordination, and Analytical Thinking in Web-Based Conversations About Vaccines on Reddit is analyzed \cite{li2022examininghomophily}. Examining computational thinking processes in modeling unstructured data is studied \cite{jiang2022examiningcomputational}. Explaining patterns in data with language models via interpretable autoprompting is explored \cite{singh2022explainingpatterns}.

\ex{Interpretability and explainability} of AI reasoning processes are also areas demanding further investigation. While methods like CoT offer some transparency \cite{wei2022chainofthought, zhang2022automaticchain, fu2022complexitybasedprompting}, understanding the internal decision-making mechanisms of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks is still an open problem. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and debugging efforts, particularly in critical applications. Characterizing biases in NLP systems \cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize} is intrinsically linked to interpretability, ensuring fairness and accountability. The use of NLP for classifying open-ended responses \cite{wilson2022classificationopenended} and the development of interpretable methods for NER \cite{chen2022btpkbasedlearning} are avenues towards better understanding model outputs. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria \cite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit} and the analysis of language change \cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} also relate to understanding underlying processes. The suitability of current LLMs for ethical decisions is questioned due to interpretability issues \cite{albrecht2022despitesuperhuman}. The effectiveness of explanation regularization methods is evaluated in NLP models \cite{joshi2022ertestevaluating}.

The potential for \ex{personalization} in AI-driven reasoning tools, inspired by work in vision-language models \cite{cohen2022thisunicorn} and applied to areas like education \cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration, markta2022accuracypupils, zimmerman2022assessingphysics, xiao2022auxiliaryteaching, nuraina2022desainbahan}, offers exciting possibilities. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven assessments \cite{kogan2022assessingacademic}, must be carefully addressed. The analysis of correlation between academic performance and learning motivation \cite{yu2022analysiscorrelation} further contextualizes educational applications. Creative mathematical reasoning's relation to cognitive motivation \cite{jonsson2022creativemathematical} and the critical analysis of big data applications \cite{kumar2022criticalanalysis} also touch upon these areas.

Furthermore, the study of \ex{foundational aspects of logic and reasoning} continues to inform AI development. Semiotic analyses of logic systems \cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis} and explorations of ontological commitment \cite{ekong2022ratiocinativestudy} provide philosophical grounding. Research into information-theoretic scaling laws \cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} and comparisons of different algorithmic approaches \cite{wankmller2022comparisonapproaches, wang2022comparisonthree, hppner2022advantagesdisadvantages} offer insights into optimizing AI systems. The benchmarking of various approaches, from spatial relationships in image generation \cite{gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial} to ACOPF solutions \cite{gopinath2022benchmarkinglargescale}, further contextualizes the performance and limitations of current AI systems. Computational stability and program testing are examined \cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment}. Cross-lingual speaker identification \cite{wolf2022crosslingualspeaker} and CrunchQA dataset for knowledge graph reasoning \cite{yu2022crunchqasynthetic} represent specific domains of investigation. The development of novel modular modeling approaches \cite{kim2022novelmodular} and the application of fuzzy controllers \cite{li2022designsimulation} are also notable.

Future research should focus on developing AI systems that exhibit deeper understanding, greater robustness, and more profound generalization capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. This includes exploring novel neuro-symbolic architectures \cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}, refining hybrid reasoning approaches \cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture genuine reasoning skills rather than surface-level correlations \cite{stolfo2022causalframework, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial}. The development of executable formal models \cite{khan2022executableformal} and experimentation frameworks \cite{katra2022experimentationframework} will be crucial for verifying the correctness of AI-generated reasoning. The investigation into the interplay between retriever and language models for reasoning is also a promising direction \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Understanding the computational experiment process \cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment} and leveraging data-free continual learning strategies \cite{smith2022constructvldatafree} are also important future directions. Continual learning on 3D point clouds \cite{zamorski2022continuallearning} and the analysis of language change \cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} offer further avenues for advancement. The ability of LLMs to learn reasoning concepts from demonstrations is also an active research question \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners}.

The crucial areas of \ex{robustness} \cite{stolfo2022causalframework}, \ex{generalization} \cite{nam2022achievingunderstanding}, and \ex{interpretability} remain significant research frontiers, underscoring the need for AI systems that exhibit genuine understanding rather than mere pattern recognition \cite{schlegel2022transformersreason}. The development of code understanding and generation capabilities \cite{liang2022codepolicies, sahu2022codequeriesdataset} represents a significant expansion of reasoning tasks. Distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller models is a key future direction \cite{shridhar2022distillingreasoning}.

The implications of this research are far-reaching, promising to transform fields reliant on quantitative analysis and logical reasoning, including science, engineering, finance, and education \cite{li2022scenariobasedexploration, tewes2022artificialintelligence, xiao2022auxiliaryteaching, nuraina2022desainbahan}. The development of AI-assisted programming tools \cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming} and adaptive modeling techniques \cite{mare2022updatethermal} further demonstrates the growing integration of structured reasoning principles into practical applications.

While remarkable progress has been made, the quest for AI systems capable of truly independent and profound mathematical and logical reasoning continues. Future research should focus on developing AI systems that exhibit deeper understanding, greater robustness, and more profound generalization capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. This includes exploring novel neuro-symbolic architectures \cite{wu2022autoformalizationneural, dong2022corrpuscodebased}, refining hybrid reasoning approaches \cite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture genuine reasoning skills rather than surface-level correlations \cite{stolfo2022causalframework, gokhale2022benchmarkingspatial}. The development of executable formal models \cite{khan2022executableformal} and experimentation frameworks \cite{katra2022experimentationframework} will be crucial for verifying the correctness of AI-generated reasoning. The investigation into the interplay between retriever and language models for reasoning is also a promising direction \cite{behnamghader2022retrieveraugmentedlanguage}. Understanding the computational experiment process \cite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment} and leveraging data-free continual learning strategies \cite{smith2022constructvldatafree} are also important future directions. Continual learning on 3D point clouds \cite{zamorski2022continuallearning} and the analysis of language change \cite{hua2022bayesvarbrulunified} offer further avenues for advancement. The ability of LLMs to learn reasoning concepts from demonstrations is also an active research question \cite{tefnik2022incontextlearners}.

In conclusion, the field of AI-driven reasoning is advancing rapidly, with LLMs and related techniques showing immense potential. This review provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current landscape, highlighting both achievements and the critical avenues for future research, ultimately contributing to the development of more capable and trustworthy AI systems in quantitative and logical domains.
