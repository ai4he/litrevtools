classifyingcropleafd-2024,Classifying Crop Leaf Diseases using Different Deep Learning Models with Transfer Learning,Lakshin Pathak; Mili Virani; Drashti Kansara,2024,International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology,930,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f64446de8b1e7d487dd1b837b5a97835e978e7b9,https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun654,10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun654,"Within the scope of the research, we put forward a technique of exactly confirming the distinctiveness of agricultural leaf pathologies with the assist of deep mastering algorithms and switch getting to know generation. We have pre-skilled models like VGG19, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0, Simple CNN where we are seeking to increase the utility for the crop disorder type. Through searching at some metrics as cited Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score for a better knowledge of a crop leaf photo category, we observe how each version performs. Our paper shows that artificial intelligence is fairly useful for the obligations of the automatic disease detection and switch mastering (as a method for reusing the existing understanding in the new software) is also beneficial. The contribution of this work to the development of reliable systems of save you sicknesses in production touches upon the rural exercise to achieve superiority fits into precision agriculture and sustainable farming. Future research ought to possibly include centered regions concerning a stability of datasets and stepped forward model interpretability which in turn will improve the fulfillment of these strategies in agricultural contexts.",,Yes,,2025-11-10T19:24:59.827Z

Chukwunweike; Andrew Nii Anang; Adewale Abayomi Adeniran; Jude Dike,2024,World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,111,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18cee31380875cba9705e9f695eb69b2b00bb15c,,10.30574/wjarr.2024.23.3.2800,"This article explores the integration of automation and deep learning in modern manufacturing to address critical challenges such as redundancy, defects, vibration analysis, and material strength. As manufacturing processes evolve, the need for more sophisticated methods to optimize production efficiency and product quality becomes paramount. Automation, coupled with deep learning techniques, offers powerful tools for enhancing manufacturing processes. These technologies enable predictive maintenance, reducing downtime by identifying potential equipment failures before they occur. Furthermore, deep learning algorithms can analyse complex data sets to detect defects in products with greater accuracy and speed than traditional methods. Vibration analysis, a key aspect of predictive maintenance, benefits from automated systems that monitor and diagnose issues in real-time, preventing costly disruptions. Additionally, deep learning models can assess material strength and predict potential failures, ensuring that products meet rigorous safety and quality standards. The synergy between automation and deep learning not only streamlines manufacturing processes but also enhances the ability to adapt to changing conditions, thereby minimizing operational inefficiencies. This article highlights the transformative impact of these technologies on the manufacturing industry, illustrating their potential through case studies and practical examples. By addressing key challenges such as redundancy and defects, automation and deep learning contribute to the creation of more reliable, efficient, and resilient manufacturing systems. The insights provided in this study underscore the importance of continued innovation in integrating these technologies to maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape.",,Yes,,2025-11-10T19:24:59.827Z
