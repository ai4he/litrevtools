  "introduction": "\\section{INTRODUCTION}\n\nMathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, underpinning advancements across science, engineering, finance, and everyday problem-solving \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The development of artificial intelligence systems capable of emulating and augmenting this capacity has been a long-standing goal in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), powered by massive datasets and sophisticated transformer architectures \\cite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened up unprecedented opportunities for tackling complex reasoning tasks \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, stolfo2022causalframework}. These models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in tasks ranging from solving arithmetic word problems \\cite{wei2022chainthought, zhang2022automaticchain} to generating proofs \\cite{wu2022autoformalizationwith}, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in domains traditionally considered exclusive to human intellect \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, stolfo2022causalframework, lu2022surveydeep}. Understanding how LLMs process and reason about mathematical and logical information is crucial for their effective and ethical deployment \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize, zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, yu2022alertadapt}. The continuous development and application of these models in diverse fields like finance \\cite{chen2022convfinqaexploring}, healthcare \\cite{tewes2022artificialintelligence}, and robotics \\cite{liang2022codepolicies, raman2022capecorrective} further underscore the importance of robust reasoning capabilities.\n\nDespite the growing interest, a consolidated view of the current state of research in LLMs for reasoning is often fragmented. Existing surveys frequently focus on broader aspects of deep learning \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}, knowledge-enhanced models \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge}, or specific domains like visual reasoning \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}. This review aims to bridge this gap by systematically analyzing the literature on the application of LLMs to mathematical and logical reasoning. Our motivation stems from the need to provide researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of the current methodologies, key findings, and outstanding challenges in this domain \\cite{zhang2022empiricalinvestigation, kumar2022answerlevelcalibration}. By synthesizing existing work, we aim to identify promising research directions and facilitate further progress \\cite{poythress2022semioticanalysis, zimmerman2022assessingphysics}. The inclusion of new papers such as those focusing on educational materials \\cite{nuraina2022desainbahan, heru2022designsupplementary}, specialized datasets \\cite{liu2022deplotoneshot, alghamdi2022armathdataset}, and debiasing techniques \\cite{tian2022debiasingmodels} enriches this overview.\n\nThis systematic literature review addresses the following research questions:\n\n1.

Journal publications in areas like IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering and Energies also contribute to the corpus \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, snchez2022clusteringapproach, ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach, zhou2022applicationthreeflow}.\n\n\\subsection{Methodological Approaches for Reasoning Tasks}\n\nSeveral key methodological approaches have emerged in the application of LLMs to reasoning tasks. A prevalent strategy involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on specific datasets tailored for reasoning \\cite{yu2022alertadapt, lu2022surveydeep}. For instance, models are fine-tuned on datasets designed for arithmetic, algebraic, or logical reasoning tasks \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, lu2022surveydeep, amaliyah2022analisiskesulitan, shidqiya2022analysisstudents, zimmerman2022assessingphysics, lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset, liang2022codepolicies, sahu2022codequeriesdataset, zhao2022collaborativereasoning, gouhar2022combininglocal, albalak2022commonsensereasoning, ye2022complementaryexplanations, fu2022complexitybasedprompting, li2022composingensembles, kuculo2022comprehensiveevent, evtikhov2022computationalexperiment, khuralay2022computersimulation, unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations, smith2022constructvldatafree, wagemaker2022concurrentnetkat, hurst2022connectingsymbolic, albilali2022constructingarabic, rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit, zamorski2022continuallearning, pan2022contrastivelanguageimage, chen2022convfinqaexploring, ehberger2022correctionlanguage, chen2022counterfactualdecoding, li2022counterfactualreasoning, ignacio2022courseguides, jonsson2022creativemathematical, kumar2022criticalanalysis, wolf2022crosslingualspeaker, yu2022crunchqasynthetic, chen2022curriculumbroadcoverage, cho2022dallevalprobing, nuraina2022desainbahan, liu2022deplotoneshot, tian2022debiasingmodels, khot2022decomposedprompting, rasal2022deepstructural, hodge2022designplanning, li2022designsimulation, tsukanov2022designcircular, heru2022designsupplementary, zoph2022designingeffective, albrecht2022despitesuperhuman, khokhlova2022developmentalgorithm, tekin2022developmentattitude, ziborov2022developmentselflearning, li2022differentiablereasoning}. Another significant direction is the development of specialized LLM architectures or modules that enhance reasoning capabilities. Zhang et al. \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention} proposed a multi-layer attention network for visual commonsense reasoning, which, while not purely mathematical, highlights the importance of fine-grained attention mechanisms for complex reasoning tasks \\cite{zhang2022multilayerattention}. Kim et al. \\cite{kim2022novelmodular} introduced a novel modular modeling approach for electromechanics, demonstrating how complex systems can be understood through component-based modeling, a principle applicable to building more interpretable reasoning systems \\cite{kim2022novelmodular}. Jeon and Van Roy \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis} conducted an information-theoretic analysis of compute-optimal neural scaling laws, providing insights into the fundamental trade-offs in model and data size for effective learning, which is crucial for designing reasoning systems \\cite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}. Furthermore, researchers are exploring prompt engineering techniques to guide LLMs towards accurate reasoning solutions. This includes zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies, which have shown considerable success in eliciting reasoning capabilities from LLMs without explicit task-specific training \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, kumar2022answerlevelcalibration, kar2022arggenprompting, zhang2022automaticchain, shridhar2022automaticgeneration, wei2022chainthought, tefnik2022incontextlearners}. The causal framework proposed by Stolfo et al. \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} is instrumental in understanding the robustness of LLMs to variations in problem descriptions, providing insights into how models arrive at their solutions \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. This causal analysis is crucial for building trust in LLM-generated reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Abramson and Emami \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods} applied pseudo-log-likelihoods for natural language scoring, highlighting a zero-shot approach's potential for robustness and efficiency, which is relevant for evaluating reasoning capabilities \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods}.

A primary concern is the robustness of LLMs to adversarial examples or minor perturbations in the input text \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, nam2022achievingunderstanding, srivastava2022beyondimitation, schlegel2022transformersreason}. Models can sometimes rely on superficial patterns rather than genuine mathematical or logical understanding \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, schlegel2022transformersreason}. The interpretability of LLM reasoning is another major area requiring attention; without clear explanations for how solutions are derived, trust and debugging become exceedingly difficult \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize, zhang2022multilayerattention, kim2022novelmodular, leemann2022oherencevaluation, chen2022btpkbasedlearning}. This echoes similar concerns in other complex AI applications \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn, zhang2022multilayerattention, chen2022btpkbasedlearning}. Hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect mathematical statements or logical inferences, are another critical issue \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, zhang2022multilayerattention}. Scalability and computational cost are also factors, especially for very large models and complex reasoning tasks \\cite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis, srivastava2022beyondimitation, krell2022crosscontaminationaccelerating}. Furthermore, the ability of LLMs to perform novel reasoning or discover new mathematical theorems is still limited compared to human experts \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. While LLMs can process and learn from vast amounts of text and formal specifications \\cite{hu2022surveyknowledge, khan2022executableformal}, their capacity for genuine mathematical insight and creativity is an ongoing debate. Ethical implications are increasingly being considered. The potential for bias in LLMs, which can manifest in the mathematical or logical content they generate, is a significant concern \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize, li2022scenariobasedexploration}.

A primary concern is the robustness of LLMs to adversarial examples or minor perturbations in the input text \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, nam2022achievingunderstanding, srivastava2022beyondimitation, schlegel2022transformersreason}. Models can sometimes rely on superficial patterns rather than genuine mathematical or logical understanding \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework, schlegel2022transformersreason}. The interpretability of LLM reasoning is another major area requiring attention; without clear explanations for how solutions are derived, trust and debugging become exceedingly difficult \\cite{alemany2022methodologycharacterize, zhang2022multilayerattention, kim2022novelmodular, leemann2022oherencevaluation, chen2022btpkbasedlearning}. This echoes similar concerns in other complex AI applications \\cite{cohen2022thisunicorn, zhang2022multilayerattention, chen2022btpkbasedlearning}. Hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect mathematical statements or logical inferences, are another critical issue \\cite{lu2022surveydeep, zhang2022multilayerattention}.
