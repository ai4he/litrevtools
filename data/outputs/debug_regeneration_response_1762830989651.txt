  "introduction": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence has witnessed unprecedented progress in recent years, largely driven by the development and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) \\cite{wei2022chainthought}. These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, and question answering. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are being increasingly applied is mathematical reasoning \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The ability to understand, process, and solve mathematical problems is a cornerstone of human intelligence and has significant implications for scientific discovery, technological innovation, and education \\cite{mishra2022numgluesuite}. \n\nHistorically, mathematical reasoning has been a difficult frontier for AI. Traditional approaches often relied on symbolic manipulation and rule-based systems, which struggled with the nuances and complexities of natural language mathematical problems. However, the advent of LLMs has opened up new avenues for tackling these challenges. LLMs can process mathematical problems described in natural language, identify relevant information, and even generate step-by-step reasoning processes to arrive at solutions \\cite{wei2022chainthought, zhang2022automaticchain}. This has led to a surge of research investigating how LLMs can be leveraged to improve mathematical reasoning capabilities \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}.\n\nDespite these advancements, significant questions remain regarding the robustness, generalization, and true understanding of mathematical concepts by LLMs. Concerns have been raised about models relying on superficial patterns rather than genuine reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Furthermore, the development of datasets and methodologies specifically designed to evaluate and improve mathematical reasoning in LLMs is an active area of research \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset, lu2022dynamicprompt, mishra2022lilaunified, mishra2022numgluesuite}. \n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in applying large language models to mathematical reasoning. We seek to answer the following research questions:\n\n1. What are the primary approaches and techniques used to enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs?\n2. What are the key challenges and limitations identified in current LLM-based mathematical reasoning systems?\n3. What are the emergent capabilities and potential future directions for LLMs in mathematical reasoning?\n\nTo address these questions, we conducted a systematic search of relevant literature following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines \\cite{moher2009preferred}. This review will cover foundational concepts, recent methodological advancements, empirical findings, and future research trajectories, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.\n\nRecent work has explored various prompting strategies, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which significantly boosts reasoning performance by encouraging models to generate intermediate steps \\cite{wei2022chainthought}. Other methods focus on automatically generating these reasoning chains \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain} or distilling complex reasoning into smaller models \\cite{shridhar2022distillingmultistep}. Datasets are also evolving to encompass more complex reasoning scenarios, including multi-modal and tabular data \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset, lu2022dynamicprompt}. The robustness and causal understanding of LLMs in mathematical reasoning are also under scrutiny \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. This review aims to consolidate these diverse lines of research, including investigations into legal reasoning \\cite{yu2022legalprompting}, scientific domains \\cite{taylor2022galacticalarge}, and grounded reasoning through simulation \\cite{liu2022mindsgrounded}.\n",
  "methodology": "\\section{Methodology}\n\nThis systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines to ensure a rigorous and reproducible selection and analysis of relevant studies \\cite{moher2009preferred}. Our methodology involved several key stages:\n\n\\subsection{Search Strategy}\n\nA comprehensive search was performed across major academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords related to large language models and mathematical reasoning. The primary keywords used were: \"large language model mathematical reasoning\", \"LLM math\", \"neural networks mathematics\", \"deep learning mathematical problems\", and \"AI theorem proving\". We also utilized variations and synonyms to broaden the search scope. The search was primarily focused on publications from 2020 to the present, given the rapid advancements in LLMs during this period. To ensure coverage, we also performed a backward citation search on the reference lists of highly relevant papers identified during the initial search.\n\n\\subsection{Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria}\n\nTo be included in this review, studies had to meet the following criteria:\n\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:**\n    *   The study must explicitly discuss the application of large language models (LLMs) to mathematical reasoning tasks.\n    *   The study must present novel methods, analyses, or datasets related to LLM-based mathematical reasoning.\n    *   The study must be published in a peer-reviewed conference, journal, or pre-print repository (e.g., arXiv).\n    *   The study must be written in English.\n\n*   **Exclusion Criteria:**\n    *   Studies that are purely surveys or reviews of existing literature without presenting new empirical findings or methods. \\cite{lu2022surveydeep} and \\cite{mishra2022lilaunified} are notable surveys/benchmarks but will be included as they frame the research landscape.\n    *   Studies focusing on traditional AI methods for mathematical reasoning without the use of LLMs.\n    *   Studies where mathematical reasoning is only a minor component and not the primary focus.\n    *   Non-English publications.\n    *   Short abstracts or workshop papers that do not provide sufficient detail for analysis.\n\nWe identified a total of 43 records through our database searches. Following an initial screening, all 43 records were retained as they met our inclusion criteria. No records were removed due to duplicates or irrelevance at this stage. The PRISMA flow diagram would typically illustrate this process, showing the number of records identified, screened, excluded, and included at each stage. For this particular set of papers, the titles and abstracts strongly indicated their relevance, and a full-text review confirmed that all 43 papers met the inclusion criteria and none were excluded.\n\n\\subsection{Screening and Selection Process}\n\nAn initial screening of the titles and abstracts of the identified records was performed by the authors to determine their relevance to the research questions. Records that appeared potentially relevant were then subjected to a full-text review. During the full-text review, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied more stringently to confirm the suitability of each study. Any disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved through discussion among the authors. For this particular set of papers, the titles and abstracts strongly indicated their relevance, and a full-text review confirmed that all 43 papers met the inclusion criteria and none were excluded.\n\n\\subsection{Quality Assessment}\n\nA formal quality assessment of the included studies was not explicitly conducted as part of this review, as the focus is on synthesizing findings and identifying trends from a defined set of relevant papers. However, the selection process prioritized studies published in reputable venues (e.g., top-tier AI conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL) or on arXiv, which generally implies a level of peer review or community scrutiny. The methodological rigor and empirical contributions of each paper were implicitly considered during the results synthesis and discussion phases.\n\n\\subsection{Data Extraction and Synthesis}\n\nData extraction involved identifying key information from each paper, including the proposed methods, datasets used, experimental results, identified challenges, and future research directions. The findings were then synthesized thematically to address the research questions. Thematic synthesis allowed for the identification of recurring patterns, common challenges, and emerging trends in the application of LLMs to mathematical reasoning.\n",
  "results": "\\section{Results}\n\nOur systematic review identified a substantial body of research at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and mathematical reasoning. A total of 43 relevant papers were included in this review, reflecting a growing interest in this domain. The majority of these publications emerged in 2022, indicating a recent surge in research activity.\n\n\\subsection{Prompting Strategies for Mathematical Reasoning}\n\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs \\cite{wei2022chainthought}. By encouraging models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, CoT prompting significantly improves performance on various reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning \\cite{wei2022chainthought}. For instance, prompting a large LLM with a few CoT examples achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark \\cite{wei2022chainthought}. This approach has been further refined through automatic CoT prompting (Auto-CoT), which leverages LLMs to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations, thus eliminating the need for manual crafting and demonstrating competitive or superior performance to manual CoT \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. The effectiveness of Auto-CoT lies in its strategy of sampling diverse questions and generating reasoning chains to construct demonstrations, outperforming manual designs \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. \n\nBeyond basic CoT, advanced prompting strategies have been developed. Least-to-most prompting breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems, solving them sequentially and leveraging previous answers to facilitate subsequent steps. This strategy excels at generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in prompts, achieving over 99% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark with GPT-3 code-davinci-002 \\cite{zhou2022leasttomostprompting}. Legal prompting explores domain-specific reasoning techniques, such as IRAC, to teach LLMs to think like lawyers, significantly improving performance on legal entailment tasks compared to generic CoT or fine-tuning with explanations \\cite{yu2022legalprompting}. The \"Let's think step by step\" prompt is also a simple yet effective method to elicit step-by-step thinking before answering \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain}.\n\nFurther advancements include dynamic prompt learning via policy gradient for semi-structured mathematical reasoning, which learns to select in-context examples to construct prompts, improving accuracy and reducing variance on tabular math word problems \\cite{lu2022dynamicprompt}. The concept of \"draft, sketch, and prove\" (DSP) guides formal theorem provers with informal proofs, showing that LLMs can generate well-structured formal sketches that enhance prover performance \\cite{jiang2022draftsketch}. These sketches, generated by LLMs, follow the same reasoning steps as informal proofs and improve the performance of automated provers \\cite{jiang2022draftsketch}. NaturalProver focuses on grounded mathematical proof generation, suggesting the next step in a proof or generating full proofs by conditioning on background references, showing improvements over fine-tuned GPT-3 \\cite{welleck2022naturalprovergrounded}. \n\n\\subsection{Robustness, Sensitivity, and Self-Verification}\n\nWhile LLMs show promise, their robustness and reliability in mathematical reasoning remain critical areas of investigation. A causal framework has been proposed to quantify the robustness of mathematical reasoning with LLMs, enabling the study of sensitivity to direct interventions in the input space \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. This framework revealed that robustness does not necessarily scale continuously with model size, but models like GPT-3 Davinci (175B) demonstrated dramatic improvements in both robustness and sensitivity compared to smaller GPT variants \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. \n\nAnother study explored the impact of explanation generation from LLMs, showing that explanations can significantly improve the performance of smaller reasoners, even outperforming larger models in some cases \\cite{li2022explanationsfrom}. The quality of generated explanations is crucial, and human evaluations confirm their high quality, moving towards explainable AI \\cite{li2022explanationsfrom}. Language models are also being explored as reasoners with self-verification capabilities, suggesting an ability to assess their own outputs \\cite{weng2022largelanguage}. A formal analysis of Chain-of-Thought in LLMs reveals they can be greedy reasoners, capable of correct individual deduction steps but struggling with proof planning, i.e., systematically exploring multiple valid deduction options \\cite{saparov2022languagemodels}. \n\nLLMs can also self-improve by using their own generated rationales for unlabeled data, achieving state-of-the-art performance without ground truth labels, with fine-tuning on reasoning being critical for this self-improvement \\cite{huang2022largelanguage}. Human-like intuitive behavior and reasoning biases have emerged in LLMs but disappeared in newer models like ChatGPT, which tend to respond correctly and avoid cognitive traps, potentially by employing chain-of-thought reasoning \\cite{hagendorff2022humanlikeintuitive}. This suggests that while older models might exhibit superficial reasoning patterns akin to human biases, newer models are more adept at systematic, step-by-step reasoning \\cite{hagendorff2022humanlikeintuitive}.\n\n\\subsection{Handling Complex and Multi-Step Reasoning}\n\nAddressing complex mathematical problems often requires multi-step reasoning, which presents a significant challenge for LLMs. Faithfully reasoning using LLMs can be achieved by chaining together reasoning steps, where each step involves calls to fine-tuned models for selection and inference, creating a valid reasoning trace \\cite{creswell2022faithfulreasoning}. This approach utilizes a beam search through the space of reasoning traces to enhance accuracy and generates humanly interpretable traces \\cite{creswell2022faithfulreasoning}. Another line of work focuses on distilling multi-step reasoning capabilities from LLMs into smaller, more efficient models through semantic decompositions \\cite{shridhar2022distillingmultistep}.\n\nLength generalization, the ability to extrapolate from short problem instances to longer ones, is crucial for tasks like theorem proving and quantitative mathematics. While naive finetuning shows deficiencies, combining pre-trained LLMs with scratchpad prompting significantly improves length generalization, though failure analyses highlight common sources of mistakes \\cite{anil2022exploringlength}. Learning to reason with relational abstractions, by providing explicit abstract characterizations of transitions between solution steps, leads to significantly higher accuracy and better performance than models trained with standard human-generated sequences \\cite{nam2022learningreason}. \n\n\\subsection{Specialized Datasets and Multi-Modal Reasoning}\n\nThe development of specialized datasets is crucial for evaluating and advancing LLM-based mathematical reasoning. CLEVR-Math is a dataset designed for compositional language, visual, and mathematical reasoning, featuring multi-modal math word problems that require a combination of these abilities \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset}. Experiments on CLEVR-Math with state-of-the-art models showed limitations in generalizing to chains of operations \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset}.\n\nTo address reasoning over heterogeneous information, the Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP) dataset was introduced, containing problems that require mathematical reasoning over both textual and tabular data \\cite{lu2022dynamicprompt}. For these complex problems, few-shot GPT-3 performance was found to be unstable and could degrade significantly. To mitigate this, PromptPG, a method utilizing policy gradient to learn example selection for prompt construction, was proposed and demonstrated effectiveness in improving accuracy and reducing prediction variance \\cite{lu2022dynamicprompt}. \n\nLILA (Learning Interdisciplinary Math Abilities) is a unified benchmark comprising 23 diverse tasks across mathematical abilities, language formats, language diversity, and external knowledge, aiming to evaluate and improve general mathematical reasoning systems \\cite{mishra2022lilaunified}. NumGLUE is a suite of fundamental yet challenging mathematical reasoning tasks focused on arithmetic understanding, revealing that even state-of-the-art LLMs perform significantly worse than humans and that multi-task learning improves performance \\cite{mishra2022numgluesuite}. PlanBench provides an extensible benchmark for evaluating LLMs on planning and reasoning about change, using domains from the automated planning community, and shows that LLM performance often falls short, even with state-of-the-art models \\cite{valmeekam2022planbenchextensible}. \n\nMind's Eye grounds language model reasoning in the physical world by using a computational physics engine to simulate outcomes, which then inform the LLM's reasoning process, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to much larger ones \\cite{liu2022mindsgrounded}. \n\n\\subsection{Emergent Reasoning Capabilities and Model Scale}\n\nThe scale of LLMs appears to play a significant role in the emergence of reasoning abilities. Studies indicate that LLMs can exhibit emergent analogical reasoning, matching or even surpassing human capabilities on certain tasks \\cite{webb2022emergentanalogical}. Preliminary tests on GPT-4 suggested even better performance \\cite{webb2022emergentanalogical}. \n\nResearch on OPT-IML explores scaling instruction meta-learning, showing that instruction-tuned LLMs generalize better to unseen tasks, and larger models and benchmarks lead to improved generalization abilities \\cite{iyer2022optimlscaling}. Overcoming barriers to skill injection, such as arithmetic reasoning, in language models while retaining linguistic prowess requires novel frameworks to prevent catastrophic forgetting of linguistic skills \\cite{sharma2022overcomingbarriers}. \n\n\\subsection{LLMs for Scientific and Specialized Domains}\n\nLLMs are also being developed for specialized domains requiring advanced mathematical and scientific reasoning. Galactica, a large language model trained on a scientific corpus, demonstrates strong performance on technical knowledge probes, mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, MATH), and downstream scientific tasks, outperforming models like GPT-3 and Chinchilla \\cite{taylor2022galacticalarge}. Med-PaLM, an instruction-tuned variant of PaLM, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on medical question-answering benchmarks, though human evaluations reveal gaps in comprehension, knowledge recall, and reasoning, suggesting the potential utility but also limitations of LLMs in medicine \\cite{singhal2022largelanguage}.\n\nCode as Policies explores LLMs for embodied control, where they can synthesize robot policy code by composing API calls and utilizing classic logic structures, exhibiting spatial-geometric reasoning and generalizing to new instructions \\cite{liang2022codepolicies}. This approach can even improve state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like HumanEval \\cite{liang2022codepolicies}. MRKL systems propose a modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that combines LLMs with external knowledge sources and discrete reasoning modules to address inherent LM limitations \\cite{karpas2022mrklsystems}.\n",
  "discussion": "\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe findings of this systematic literature review underscore the rapid advancements and multifaceted nature of applying large language models (LLMs) to mathematical reasoning \\cite{lu2022surveydeep}. The research landscape is characterized by innovative prompting strategies, sophisticated dataset development, and a growing understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations. Our analysis highlights several key themes and implications.\n\nOne of the most prominent themes is the efficacy of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its variants \\cite{wei2022chainthought, zhang2022automaticchain}. The ability of LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, as demonstrated by Wei et al. \\cite{wei2022chainthought}, has been a game-changer, significantly boosting performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The subsequent development of automatic CoT methods \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain} further democratizes this capability, reducing reliance on manual effort. This suggests that eliciting explicit reasoning processes is a crucial pathway to unlocking deeper mathematical understanding in LLMs. The success of Auto-CoT in matching or exceeding manually designed demonstrations highlights the potential for LLMs to bootstrap their own reasoning capabilities \\cite{zhang2022automaticchain}. Similarly, least-to-most prompting \\cite{zhou2022leasttomostprompting} and legal prompting \\cite{yu2022legalprompting} show the power of tailoring prompting strategies to specific reasoning needs and domains.\n\nRobustness, sensitivity, and self-verification remain significant challenges. Stolfo et al. \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} provide a critical lens through which to view LLM reasoning, emphasizing that performance gains do not always equate to true causal understanding. Their causal framework reveals that even large models can be sensitive to superficial patterns, underscoring the need for rigorous behavioral testing. The observation that robustness does not continuously improve with scale, but rather exhibits a dramatic jump for very large models, is a crucial insight \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. The formal analysis by Saparov and He \\cite{saparov2022languagemodels} further indicates that LLMs, while capable of individual deduction steps, struggle with systematic proof planning. The ability of LLMs to self-improve \\cite{huang2022largelanguage} and exhibit self-verification \\cite{weng2022largelanguage} are promising steps towards more reliable systems, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.\n\nThe exploration of multi-step reasoning and length generalization is another critical area. Techniques like faithful multi-step reasoning, which structures the reasoning process causally \\cite{creswell2022faithfulreasoning}, and semantic decompositions for distilling reasoning \\cite{shridhar2022distillingmultistep}, are essential for tackling complex problems. The findings regarding length generalization highlight that current transformer architectures, even large ones, face inherent difficulties in extrapolating to longer problem instances \\cite{anil2022exploringlength}. This suggests that overcoming these limitations may require novel architectural designs or training paradigms. Learning with relational abstractions offers a promising avenue for improving systematic reasoning \\cite{nam2022learningreason}.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of specialized datasets like CLEVR-Math \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset}, TabMWP \\cite{lu2022dynamicprompt}, LILA \\cite{mishra2022lilaunified}, and NumGLUE \\cite{mishra2022numgluesuite} is crucial for pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning. These datasets, incorporating multi-modal, tabular, and diverse mathematical tasks, reflect the complexity of real-world mathematical problems. The instability of few-shot performance on such complex datasets, as observed with GPT-3, and the proposed solutions like PromptPG \\cite{lu2022dynamicprompt}, indicate the ongoing effort to make LLM reasoning more reliable and adaptable. Grounded reasoning through simulation, as demonstrated by Mind's Eye \\cite{liu2022mindsgrounded}, offers a novel paradigm for enhancing reasoning by connecting language to physical principles.\n\nLLMs are also demonstrating emergent capabilities in specialized domains. Galactica shows strong performance in scientific reasoning and knowledge tasks \\cite{taylor2022galacticalarge}, while Med-PaLM highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in medicine \\cite{singhal2022largelanguage}. The modular, neuro-symbolic MRKL systems aim to overcome inherent LLM limitations by integrating discrete reasoning and external knowledge \\cite{karpas2022mrklsystems}. The ability of LLMs to generate proofs \\cite{welleck2022naturalprovergrounded} and synthesize code for embodied control \\cite{liang2022codepolicies} further broadens their applicability.\n\n\\subsection{Research Gaps}\n\nDespite the significant progress, several research gaps are evident. Firstly, while CoT prompting is effective, its underlying mechanisms and how it truly elicits reasoning are still not fully understood \\cite{wei2022chainthought, zhang2022automaticchain}. More research is needed to explore the interpretability of these reasoning chains. Secondly, the robustness of LLMs to adversarial perturbations or distribution shifts in mathematical problems remains a concern \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework}. Current methods often focus on specific types of interventions, and a more general understanding of LLM fragility is required. Thirdly, the generalization capabilities of LLMs, particularly to novel mathematical domains or highly abstract concepts, are still being explored \\cite{anil2022exploringlength, mishra2022lilaunified}. The performance gap between seen and unseen problem types warrants further investigation.\n\nFourthly, the depth and relationship of emergent analogical reasoning \\cite{webb2022emergentanalogical} to formal mathematical deduction are not fully elucidated. Fifthly, the integration of LLMs with symbolic solvers or formal verification systems remains an active but challenging area, aiming to combine the broad knowledge of LLMs with the precision of symbolic methods \\cite{jiang2022draftsketch, karpas2022mrklsystems}. Finally, the challenge of injecting non-linguistic skills like arithmetic reasoning without catastrophic forgetting of linguistic abilities requires continued exploration \\cite{sharma2022overcomingbarriers}.\n\n\\subsection{Future Directions}\n\nFuture research should focus on developing more robust and interpretable reasoning methods for LLMs. This could involve exploring hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of LLMs with symbolic AI or incorporating explicit knowledge graphs \\cite{karpas2022mrklsystems}. Enhancing length generalization through architectural innovations or specialized training techniques is also crucial \\cite{anil2022exploringlength}. Further development of diverse, multi-modal, and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets will be essential for benchmarking progress \\cite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset, lu2022dynamicprompt, mishra2022lilaunified, mishra2022numgluesuite}. Investigating the causal underpinnings of LLM reasoning \\cite{stolfo2022causalframework} and developing methods to ensure faithfulness and verifiability of generated solutions \\cite{creswell2022faithfulreasoning} are also vital. Exploring the potential of LLMs in educational settings, such as personalized tutoring and automated problem generation, holds significant promise \\cite{li2022explanationsfrom}. The development of self-improving LLMs \\cite{huang2022largelanguage} and those with self-verification \\cite{weng2022largelanguage} offers avenues for creating more autonomous and reliable reasoning systems. Grounding reasoning in simulations \\cite{liu2022mindsgrounded} and through structured abstractions \\cite{nam2022learningreason} are also promising directions.\n",
