  "introduction": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, from text generation to complex question answering \u005ccite{brown2020language}. A particularly challenging and important domain where LLMs are increasingly being applied is mathematical reasoning. The ability to understand, process, and generate mathematical content is fundamental to scientific discovery, engineering, finance, and many aspects of daily life. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of robust mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing goal in the field of AI \u005ccite{lu2022surveydeep}. The systematic analysis of reasoning processes, whether in natural language \u005ccite{stolfo2022causalframework, yu2022analysiscorrelation}, formal logic \u005ccite{poythress2022semioticanalysis, carette2022centralsubmonads, fiore2022formalmetatheory, yoon2022formalreasoning}, or applied domains like clinical reasoning \u005ccite{ricci2022petrinetbasedapproach}, is crucial for advancing AI capabilities. The design of supplementary mathematics modules, for instance, aims to improve students' reasoning abilities \u005ccite{heru2022designsupplementary}. Formal methods and verification are also explored for system analysis \u005ccite{khan2022executableformal, katra2022experimentationframework, tran2022formalspecification}. \n\nRecent advancements in LLMs, particularly those based on transformer architectures \u005ccite{vaswani2017attention}, have opened new avenues for tackling complex mathematical problems. These models, trained on massive datasets, possess an emergent ability to perform arithmetic operations, solve algebraic equations, and even engage with more abstract mathematical concepts \u005ccite{abramson2022applicationpseudologlikelihoods, wei2022chainofthought}. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remain active areas of research. Issues such as susceptibility to superficial patterns in problem descriptions \u005ccite{stolfo2022causalframework}, the need for explicit reasoning capabilities \u005ccite{zhang2022multilayerattention}, and challenges in out-of-distribution generalization \u005ccite{nam2022achievingunderstanding} highlight the ongoing challenges. The development of AI-assisted programming further underscores the integration of AI with structured problem-solving \u005ccite{gulwani2022aiassistedprogramming}. Furthermore, understanding the information-theoretic aspects of neural scaling laws \u005ccite{jeon2022informationtheoreticanalysis}, developing frameworks for formal methods \u005ccite{khan2022executableformal, poythress2022semioticanalysis, katra2022experimentationframework, carette2022centralsubmonads, unknown2022computerverifiedfoundations, wagemaker2022concurrentnetkat, tran2022formalspecification}, and autoformalizing mathematical problems \u005ccite{wu2022autoformalizationwith, wu2022autoformalizationneural} are critical for advancing rigorous reasoning systems.

Constructing datasets for specific linguistic phenomena, such as Arabic reading comprehension, is also an ongoing effort \u005ccite{albilali2022constructingarabic}. The construction of goodness-of-fit criteria for impulse response functions highlights the application of mathematical reasoning in signal processing \u005ccite{rozora2022constructiongoodnessoffit}.

Datasets like GSM8K and MATH \u005ccite{kobelski2022rethinking, hendrycks2021math} are frequently used to assess LLMs' ability to perform calculations, solve equations, and interpret natural language descriptions of mathematical scenarios. Surveys such as \u005ccite{lu2022surveydeep} provide a comprehensive overview of these tasks and associated datasets. Datasets like ArMATH are specifically designed for Arabic math word problems \u005ccite{alghamdi2022armathdataset}. The automatic generation of Socratic subquestions aims to aid in teaching math word problems \u005ccite{shridhar2022automaticgeneration}. The CLEVR-Math dataset targets compositional language, visual, and mathematical reasoning \u005ccite{lindstrm2022clevrmathdataset}. Analysis of students' mathematical thinking and learning difficulties is also prevalent \u005ccite{shidqiya2022analysisstudents, amaliyah2022analisiskesulitan, hurst2022connectingsymbolic, jonsson2022creativemathematical, nuraina2022desainbahan}. Computational experiment and nondimensionalization of equations are explored \u005ccite{evtikhov2022computationalexperiment}.
