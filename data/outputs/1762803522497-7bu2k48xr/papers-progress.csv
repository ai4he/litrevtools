wizardmathempowering-2023,WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct,Haipeng Luo; Qingfeng Sun; Can Xu; Pu Zhao; Jian-Guang Lou; Chongyang Tao; Xiubo Geng; Qingwei Lin; Shifeng Chen; Dongmei Zhang,2023,International Conference on Learning Representations,578,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd18782960f9ee4c66b79e1518b342ad3f8d19e7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09583,10.48550/arXiv.2308.09583,"Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

Hartshorn; Elvis Saravia; Andrew Poulton; Viktor Kerkez; Robert Stojnic,2022,arXiv.org,892,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d645a3fd276918374fd9483fd675c28e46506d1,,,"Information overload is a major obstacle to scientific progress. The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2% versus 49.0%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical MMLU by 41.3% to 35.7%, and PaLM 540B on MATH with a score of 20.4% versus 8.8%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev of 77.6% and 52.9%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms BLOOM and OPT-175B on BIG-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.",arxiv:2211.09085,Yes,,2025-11-10T19:38:43.927Z
